"Please make sure that federally qualified health centers continue to receive adequate reimbursement and that there is no hospital led efforts to minimize those reimbursements throughout the process. As hospitals continue to purchase primary care practices, they are under more pressure to corner those Medicaid dollars, leaving a poor payer mix for FQHC's."

"The Medicaid reform proposal ignores some highly pertinent facts and is not in the best interest of our state. The format suggested will be cumbersome to formulate and will add layers of bureaucratic complexity to the Medicaid system in North Carolina.
This terribly divisive proposal ignores the fact that the NC Medicaid system is nationally recognized as doing well. It has over 90% of primary care and many specialists with support by nonprofit Community Care of NC which is a consortium of 14 nonprofit entities covering all 100 counties. It works with every hospital in NC, with thousands of private practicing physicians, with every county health department, with all 34 federally qualified health centers, and with all 27 rural health centers. CCNC is a model which numerous other states have tried to emulate.
While enrollment growth has generated an increase in total costs, the per capita cost of healthcare for Medicaid patients in NC has gone down since 2010. There was a 4% decrease in 2011, and by 2015 a greater than 8% reduction as compared with 2010. No Medicaid program in any other state has had such experience. In fact, no commercial insurance company nor any MCO can show such results. What is the logic of disrupting such a successful homegrown system with for-profit MCOs that will cost more and generate aggravations for the provider community?
Notable is that these cost savings under the current system have accrued through improved clinical outcomes for patients, resulting in less emergency department visits and less hospitalizations.
In recent 12 public hearings across the state over 100 physicians to speak expressed disapproval of the reform plan and spoke in support of CCNC. They also voiced serious concerns for having to deal with multiple entities within the Medicaid system to gain reimbursement for services delivered.
At these hearings were repeated pleas for NC to shrink the uninsured population by accepting the federal money that has been allocated to expand Medicaid in our state. To do so would help the economy in every county across NC, especially in the less affluent regions. It would generate jobs and be a huge boost to hospitals and safety net clinics.
NC has a model Medicaid system that has a proven track record for decreasing per capita costs that no other state nor any MCO can rival. Rather than scuttle it, pragmatic good sense calls for its expansion. Let's do what is best for the people of North Carolina.

"As an employee of a Western North Carolina Community Health Center and also a Certified Application Counselor, I see firsthand the lives impacted by North Carolina's rejection of Medicaid Expansion. This affects the health and well-being of real people, such as a 63 year old retiree on a fixed income - too low for ACA subsidies but categorically ineligible for Medicaid in NC; a mother making minimum wage, whose income turns out to be higher than North Carolina's ridiculously low limit for parents yet under 100% FPL so again, ineligible for ACA subsidies; or a chronically ill middle-aged man who finds it difficult to work as he has gout, cannot afford out-of pocket healthcare that could ease his pain, and therefore cannot work enough to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. These are just a sampling of the likely half of a million people who are unable to access healthcare and are suffering as a result of living in the Medicaid Gap.

As the federal agency enabled to review the NC medicaid reform proposal, I believe that you should make Medicaid Expansion a condition of any reform proposal. People who really need medical assistance, our most vulnerable, poverty-stricken populations, should have access to life-saving medical care."
"I strongly urge you to include Medicaid Expasion in North Carolina's Medicaid Reform package. One in five adults under 65 in our state are uninsured! I know people personally who are not insured, and it's because they cannot afford insurance. We will lose $25 billion dollars in Federal matching funds between 2016 and 2020 if we do not expand Medicaid this year. Why do we choose to throw those dollars away, lose jobs, and continue the cycle of poverty?"
The Department of Social Services needs to be reformed before you even think about expanding Medicaid. Physicians need to have their fees increased in order to take on more patients
"Please do you job and respect and protect the health of all North Carolinians for some of the following reasons:
Here are some bullet points for the costs of not expanding Medicaid:
1 in 5 adults under 65 remains uninsured in NC (around 500,000)
Not expanding Medicaid is already hindering job creation and economic growth because NC is not capturing billions in federal matching dollars that would otherwise flow into the state economy to make expansion more affordable.
If NC does not expand Medicaid by 2016, $21 billion in federal matching funds will be lost between 2016 and 2020.
Statewide, about half the jobs not created would be in health care (hospitals and clinics); almost half would be in other sectors such as construction or retail and wholesale trade.
Small hospitals and clinics have had to close–particularly affecting rural poor.
Non-economic reasons to expand Medicaid:
When parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured and they are better able to care for their children.
By not closing the gap, the cycle of poverty and sickness continues. Consequences of families falling into crisis because of a lack of health coverage and a medical crisis include foreclosures and evictions- having to make the decision to pay the rent or pay for much needed medication."
"Yes, please expand Medicaid to cover the insurance gap left between the Affordable Healthcare Act and the ability to pay private insurance. I know far too many people who are affected by this gap, most of which are the ones that need healthcare coverage the most."
"Helping ensure individuals are able to lead productive lives and make meaningful contributions to their communities is the wisest use of public funds. Shortages, obstacles and restrictions to care resources create risks to personal health and the community at large. Enabling investments produce measure-able benefits for both individuals and tbeir communities. I urge support for the proposed medicaid changes."
"Do not understand why our state legislators want to dismantle one of the best delivery systems in the country, a program which other states would like to emulate. It makes no sense health-wise or fiscally.

"I am an insurance professional in western North Carolina . The ACA was designed to include Medicaid expansion. Without it, rates for all persons in the state are increasing faster than if Medicaid had been expanded. Couple that with lost affordable health care for these citizens with the oblivious negative effects plus North Carolina tax dollars going unused makes Medicaid expansion a priority. Thank You - Dave Trout"
"I work as a behavioral health provider at an FQHC in Henderson County, NC. We serve a great number of uninsured patients who would potentially qualify for Medicaid if it were expanded in our state. In addition, my agency could provide many services that would benefit our patients if more had insurance. PLEASE EXPAND MEDICAID IN NORTH CAROLINA!!!"
"The LME system is awful in NC. I have two sons with autism and a daughter with mental illness. My one son has been on the waiting list for CAP/C since 2010. My daughter was seen through a local LME and her mental health treatment was awful. She was placed on a high dosage of drugs and my concerns about her being a zombie were dismissed. After her second inpatient stay in a behavioral health hospital, she was fortunate to be able to receive services from Wake Forest Baptist Health Behavioral Health. She has a better, but not perfect outcome. She is still seeing a therapist that resides in the DSS system, but I think she is in need of something between weekly therapy and hospitalization. There seems to be nothing.
My sons with autism get no treatment from the Medicaid system. I did, while I could afford it, send them to a group therapy type setting once a week at a local non-profit. My older son fell into a gap between younger kids and older teens. He stopped going for that reason. My other son did not seem to benefit much. He would benefit from individual assistance, but he lost his IEP due to not acting autistic enough for his teachers. I suppose they only understand autism through movies like Rain Man.
Switching to a system that rewards medical professionals for providing less services to increase their bottom line is a horrible idea. It is already difficult to have busy providers listen to the underlying issues of children's problems, without knowing that ignoring my child's maladies contribute to the bottom line. Not saying all providers would do this, but when you have an elusive diagnosis, like autism can be, it would be easier to just ignore symptoms of higher functional autistic children. The same for children with anxiety disorders."
"Medical care of low income people is complicated in many ways for the doctors, nurses, and PA's that care for them. Minimizing the complications of the system of care is essential in order to allow as much attention as possible to be given to the care of the patients.
The proposal submitted by the state of North Carolina would add harmful complexity, like all other multiple insurer situations that I am aware of.

I believe that if you review the performance of our current system, Community Care of North Carolina, you will find that it performs so well that there is no reason to launch alternative demonstration experiments. CCNC is a national model, being able to document savings of $1B from 2007-2010 (Millman Inc report Dec 2011), and receiving the Hearst Health Prize from the Jefferson College of Population Health in March of 2016. It has grown organically and deliberatively from a Wilson County project developed by a community-minded physician 25 years ago and has incorporated all appropriate concepts of health information, integration between providers and other community resources, and quality improvement. Designed and managed by providers, it is responsive to the needs of providers and patients.

CCNC has always cared about patients and providers. I doubt that the managed care entities that this proposal would permit would do the same. I believe that intent is a major determinant of outcome."
"As the federal agency enabled to review the NC medicaid reform proposal, I believe that you should make Medicaid Expansion a condition of any reform proposal. People who really need medical assistance should have access to life-saving medical care."
Expand Medicaid in NC! It's just common sense.
This bill/Waiver is completely ludicrous. It ignores and disbands a Nationally recognized Medicaid program in Community Care of North Carolina. CCNC and its 14 statewide networks has proven to be an efficient and cost effective approach to managing Medicaid dollars. It has also increased the access and quality of care that our most vulnerable patients receive. They are a leading example of how to reign in cost and increase quality. The Waiver would strip North Carolina of a program that many other states would love to duplicate. I would ask CMS to reject this waiver as there is no need to fix what is not broken but in fact working quite efficiently. Thank you.
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Medicaid Reform Waiver Application. We are

the largest pediatric group in NC, recognized by NCQA as a Patient Centered Medical Home

with 17 sites serving 64 of 100 counties, with more than 100,000 pediatric visits per year.

Our largest focus with medicaid reform is to maintain/ improve access to care for the children of

North Carolina. With recent medicaid cuts, access to care has been significantly compromised

with many private offices no longer accepting medicaid patients or have had to close down due

to lack of financial sustainability. This in turn has increased the burden on emergency rooms

which is a major contributor to rising healthcare costs. Hence, we urge you to revise provider

reimbursement rates and ensure they are comparable to Medicare rates to ensure access to care.

As a group, our mission is to provide accessible, affordable, quality care. By honoring same day

appointments, walk-ins and extended hour clinic, we have a proven track record in effectively

reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations. With a focus on quality based care,

practice reimbursement rates should ensure pay for achievable quality performance measures.

We urge you to ensure medicaid reform addresses these key elements assuring access and quality

of care provided to the children of NC."
"it is so important for access and quality patient care in the pediatric community, and this causes concerns about the administrative challenges of having 15 different providers; we strongly belief in the benefits of CCNC; the importance of network adequacy/access to specialists; etc."
please expand medicaid in NC
"I am opposed to reforming North Carolina Medicaid as proposed. The changes appeared as a result of pressures to privatize Medicaid in order to have predictable state budgets. The care of patients under the current non-for-profit system called Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) received national recognition for innovation in healthcare, and created an infrastructure which is threatened to be dismantled under the new proposal. CCNC proven results include cost savings in the millions of dollars for North Carolina, year after year, in reduced emergency room utilization or hospitalizations. Many of the potential benefits in the proposed change already exist under CCNC. Privatization will result in increased costs to tax payers (federal and state), and line the pockets of for-profit companies not even located in North Carolina. The current CCNC managed care infrastructure is intimately aligned with safety net providers as well. Disruption and reorganization, especially for safety net providers, in a time with concurrent rapid change in healthcare alliances and ACO structures is further distancing our healthcare organizations from the people we serve. Given the difficult political climate, the lack of expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina, the minimal adoption of access to insurances through the exchange (few choices) from the Affordable Care Act, the threat to care of those accessing care through safety net providers is no small concern. If the vision for the future of North Carolina Medicaid as proposed were driven by the best quality of care for the citizens of North Carolina, then I would support it. Innovation and competition could benefit our state and reduce costs to tax payers. This proposal is politically motivated and shameful. It doesn't have to be inevitable, if Federal-level decision makers have the authority and will to block it."
"I feel Medicaid should be available to individuals who are in need of a service regardless of their age, race or if their income is higher than poverty level. I personally make this comment because I work at a low salary but when I had cancer, I could not afford the copays, deductibles and the medication I had to buy out of pocket. Four years later, I am still paying for hospital bills associated with the cancer. I was more fortunate than most, but at that particular time all I could think was if I could just get a little help get over the hump. It has created a hardship for myself. It makes you feel like you can not go for tests because you adding one more bill. There should be a way for all people to benefit when there is a need. There should also be a way to prevent the fraud of these programs. Most of the fraud comes from people not seeing a regular doctor especially children. There seems to be a stigma of who cares about going to the doctor when we can just go to the ER. I can not afford the ER and people have the attitude to for symptoms associated with STDs, to find out they are pregnant, etc. Most of these can be treated at a doctor rather than an ER."
"I am a primary care pediatrician practicing in a private practice in a rural part of North Carolina. I have significant concerns that the Medicaid reform proposal will hurt an already successful program

ACCESS
Complexity may reduce access. With a basic model of 15 different Medicaid insurance companies (PHP – Prepaid Health Plans), complexity is inherent in the design. Complexity would likely reduce access to care not just for children insured through Medicaid and Health Choice, but all children, especially in rural areas. (For example, if practices close rather than make all the changes needed to participate with PHPs; if providers spend more time on paperwork and less time on patient care; if pediatricians chose to retire rather than deal with all the new and multiple requirements, etc.)

Payment structure may reduce access and quality of care. Higher percentages of payment going to PHP means less money for health care for children. A survey of NC pediatricians by NCPeds in March 2015 found that recent cuts (relating to loss of the ACA bump plus state changes) led practices to limit the number of Medicaid patients and that additional cuts would likely lead to limits on seeing Medicaid patients (46%), staff lay-offs (31%), practice closures (8%), and retiring earlier than planned (17%). If there are fewer practitioners or practices, all children in the area will lose access to care, not just those with public health insurance.

Networks may not have adequate access to pediatric providers, especially specialists. There are only a handful of pediatric specialists, such as urologists, in the state. It is unclear how access to needed specialists for children will be assured. Adult specialists who also see children (such as ENTs) may not want to deal with increased hassle of multiple different Medicaid plans for low payment on a handful of children.

LOSS OF CCNC
CCNC provides important benefits for child health. CCNC has a proven effective strategy to improve care while reducing cost. While DHHS clearly intends to keep many of the elements of CCNC, CCNC itself will go away. Instead of one care manager and one set of metrics, practices may have to deal with five (or more depending on their region). The state will lose the focus, improved quality and reduced cost that CCNC has been able to achieve. Practices could become frustrated and scattered as a different PHP comes in with a different area of focus, different QI initiatives, etc."

"With decades of experience, I fear and suspect reorganization of Medicaid services to children will be detrimental to patients and providers/ quality of care and economics. North Carolina since the 1970s had evolved to become an enviable system of health care delivery to children with organizational and funding success. Importantly, physical driven initiatives had brought expanded enrollment of children with ever expanding cost saving strategies--all driven its the conceptual goal that more savings resultant from unified provider support would be turned to generate and fund services to more children. The millions of savings did not go to providers, vendors or organizational entities. CCNC was our award winning consistent tool to bring much of this success.

Being a solo provider, I am aware that bureaucratic , organizational layers added will have continuous pressure to diminish reimbursement to providers and divert segments of value to any entity placed between layers of organization. Cost containment in such a way diverts a significant portion of value away from reinforcing re-imbursement for quality care. This is cost containment tool dressed as an effort to improve care. With the best of intention(I am unsure this is the case) and appropriately focused entities, this will take decades to become effective--yet impositions of structural changes will come forth in abundance.

With a system that diminishes reimbursement while it imposes layers of administrative demands, solo and small practices will struggle. I believe the CCNC model from its early years is the best model for child advocacy in North Carolina. Politically driven changes have a poor track record with which to challenge CCNC success. The NC Pediatric Society and its members have long been committed to our state's children. Why do we seek to kill off a proven great success?"
Patient should be given the option of using retail clinics and urgent care centers when their PCP office is not open. A lot of money could be saved if patient did not have to go to the Emergency Room.
"I have been a provider of pediatric general primary care in a moderate sized community in central North Carolina for the past 17 years. I have appreciated working with the physician lead entity call Community Care of North Carolina for these years to help reduce the cost of quality medicaid services for pateints in North Carolina. We have been a model for other states in keeping costs down, I strongly oppose the proposed waiver to CMS to change the NC Medicaid program to a managed care organization model from the current fee for service model. I predict that these changes will result in profits for third party insurers at the expense of primary care providers, resulting in far fewer primary care providers willing to see Medicaid patients. Our practice is the largest provider of Pediatric primary care in our service area of over 250,000 people. We will very likely be forced to drastically reduce our Medicaid insured numbers if our reinbursements are reduced as I predict under this model. We will be forced into a higher degree of administrative paperwork dealing with multiple Medicaid HMOs, increasing our costs to continue to see these patients. I strongly urge CMS to reject this proposed change and continue to allow North Carolina to provide high quality and cost effective pediatrics care for our children under Medicaid and the CCNC. If nothing else, please exclude children 18 and under from these proposed changes.

"Recent article that 50% of prisons are filled with individuals with mental health issues. Primary care pediatricians are NOT receiving extra help in training and in compensation for caring for these kids prior to getting into trouble. 70% of those not graduating from High school will get arrested; 70% of African Americans will be arrested! Find a way to compensate those practices, like my own, that employee at our own dollar, trained educators and trained health providers to provide mental health and ADHD services, cover learning disabilities, and look at the entire family dynamics. The cost savings is tremendous. For a $2 million investment I have proven that I can save the state of NC over $400 million over 10 years! James M Poole, MD FAAP"
"1. I would love to see some ""out the box"" thinking when it comes to the integration of behavioral health care and primary care.

2. As a behavioral health provider and owner of group practice, it would be wonderful if the MCO's would """"allow"""" me to contract with physicians and place skilled licensed behavioral health providers in the physicians office to do behavioral health assessments, emergency counseling, EAP type referral counseling, etc. However, that would mean they would have to allow the group practice to ""add a location"" - the physician's office.
That has not been allowed since soon after the MCO.s took over (about 3 years ago?) One can't grow the behavioral health group practice with medicaid, because additional offices can not be utilized - that is ""adding a location"" and is rejected.
I am hoping that someone gets creative to make this integration work well!"
"Please maintain the diverse set of providers particularly the Enhanced Registered Role Nurse. Public Health Departments have been able to provide affordable accessible care to vulnerable populations.

Also, Please insist that the MCOs and the PLE utilize the ""Impactable Score"" developed and implemented by CCNC. It's unique and enables a Medicaid care management system to be efficient and effective."
"I am requesting FULL MEDICAID EXPANSION as the ACA was intended. Low income North Carolinians who fall in the Medicaid gap are dying every day due to the political interests of Republicans. When elected, they vowed to protect the interests of NC citizens and for 4 years they have been violating their vows. The health and lives of NC citizens should be their top priority, not their political opposition to the ACA. Thanks for the opportunity to comment on this critical issue."
I support the continuation of MCOs as state-run entities under the direction of DMA and DHHS and not the privatization of these entities under the control of or absorption by private insurance companies.
It is critically important that we support efforts to address social determinants of health. Putting our largest funding mechanism for healthcare services to work to address complex social issues that drive population health is critical to our overall success as a state and as a country. Please support inclusion of flexible services and approaches in our demonstration waiver.
"I have serious reservations about this waiver generally because everything that has been wrong with the Medicaid system can be fixed with stronger over site. What seems to be missing is it looks like an attempt to privatize Medicaid and to not expand Medicaid. I have listen to providers they have great reservation about these proposed changes along with hundreds that work with the Medicaid population and most importantly the patients that this will effect in a negative way are not being taken into consideration. It appears the recipients will be taking the fall for gross negligence by DHHS how many times has the Federal Administration of DHHS had to literally slap NC hands over the mess and poor operation of the current system. There are patients now that are not receiving adequate healthcare and this will make that worst. I understand that they will be given a choice between HMO's and if they do not then one will be chosen for them, but look at the demographics of this population many or most do not have the literacy or the means to make that type of decision. What they need is access to healthcare and an increase in the number of providers. Providers that are not saddled with getting permission from a HMO who by their very essence look at cost and delay or deny more service and take the decisions away from providers. . There is a proven system with CCNC that has saved the Medicaid system millions of dollars why would you dismantle a model that has proven to work and in fact other states have modeled a system similar because of the cost savings. This seems more political than it does to improve the healthcare of Medicaid recipients. Why is the question? In conclusion there is much that needs to be reviewed and looked at but to throw the baby out with the bathwater is foolish. Please consider the impact this will have on the recipients rather than trying to except responsibility for bad over site . Keep what has been working and correct the problems that have been well documented . Expand Medicaid please too many in the state have fallen permanently it looks like into a hole with no way out and yes there are those that die r/t no access to healthcare in a country as rich as this this is nothing to be proud of . The exchanges are working and the cost of healthcare will continue to go down when people have access."
"I urge the state to expand Medicaid in every county in North Carolina.

Hundreds of thousand of people will not have health insurance, and thus not have access to preventative and continuing health care, if we don't.

Thousands of people will continue to die each year unnecessarily and preventably if we don't, because Medicaid expansion is a matter of life and death. A 2012 study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that expanding Medicaid by 500,000 enrollees is associated with 2,840 fewer deaths each year. This is the number of people estimated to enroll if North Carolina expanded Medicaid. A 2014 study in Health Affairs noted that if the expansion population is healthier than expected we may see between 455 and 1,145 fewer deaths each year after expansion.

Thousands of people will lose jobs, and will not get new jobs that are there for the asking, if we don't. A 2014 report from the Center for Health Policy Research at The George Washington University, with partners Cone Health Foundation and Kate B Reynolds Charitable Trust (available at www.ncmedicaidexpansion.com) shows that North Carolina could gain $21 billion in federal tax revenue statewide, create 43,000 jobs, and generate $161 million in new county tax revenue between 2016 and 2020 if the state closes the coverage gap.

Not expanding Medicaid is an extreme example of ideological devastation, in a legislative session characterized by ideological devastation. It costs nothing to do, and the failure to do it means over 300,000 people do not have health insurance, do not have access to preventative and ongoing health care, that thousands of people will die, and thousands of people will lose jobs and do not get jobs that are there for the asking, all for some misguided ideological excuse.

Have humanity, be human, do it.

Thank you for considering my view."
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on North Carolina's Medicaid Reform 1115 Demonstration. North Carolina has proposed a major change to the delivery of Medicaid in our state. One of the goals of the waiver is to connect children and families to better health. While we appreciate the extension of eligibility to families in the child welfare system, we remain deeply concerned about the hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians who will remain without access to care under the proposed plan. We urge North Carolina's leaders to expand Medicaid eligibility as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, thus providing essential health care access to more than 300,000 individuals in our state who currently have no other options available to them. They do not fall into an eligible category for Medicaid and they earn too little to qualify for financial assistance in the Health Insurance Marketplace. Here in Mecklenburg County, we have over 32,000 individuals in the coverage gap.1 Left without any options, they must rely on charity, free clinics, and the emergency room for care. Lack of coverage can also result in death. Estimates indicate from 450 to 1,100 North Carolinians die unnecessarily every year because they have no access to care.2
Extending coverage will not only benefit the health of North Carolinians, but also family finances as well as county and state-level economies. In NC, we know that closing the Coverage Gap will help nearly 15,000 families avoid financial stress annually as they are less likely to encounter costly medical bills.3 On the county level, we know that closing the Gap will help 16 rural hospitals keep their doors open.4 Statewide we know that 43,000 jobs would have been created by 2020 if policymakers would have accepted full federal funding to increase all North Carolinians' access to care in 2016.5
· States that have expanded Medicaid have improved financial well-being for new enrollees, leading to fewer unpaid bills. Research estimates that expansion reduced third-party collections by $600 to $1000 per individual in expansion states.8
· Expanded Medicaid has been a common contributor to job growth and positive economic impacts over time through the influx of federal funding, increased state and local business activity, and collected tax revenues.
There is no justification to continue to deny NC Medicaid Expansion!"
"Children are a majority of the affected caseload for medicaid reform. CCNC has been very helpful in ensuring that many of these needy children did not fall through the cracks and received necessary mental health and physical services. Providers that take medicaid already have to jump through many hoops. Fragmenting this system further will be devastating for access to care--having multiple medicaid plans will mean that fewer providers continue to offer medicaid. Already there are many issues with access and quality of care for children with medicaid, the area that I am most familiar with is mental health. Unfortunately children living in poverty suffer more frequently adverse life events are are more likely to have mental health care needs. Unfortunately with the fragmentation of the system many child psychiatrists and other providers already aren't taking medicaid or taking a limited number because of low reimbursement. Fragmenting this system and creating multiple types of medicaid will only make this much worse. There is clear data that not only treatment for things such as abuse and resulting Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, early onset psychosis can lead to better outcomes in multiple levels. The best part is the providing necessary care to these children actually saves the system lots of money long term and this has been shown in many early intervention trials and specific types of mental health treatment. The savings comes from reduction in hospital costs, reduction in missed work days, reduction in hospitalizations and long term care facilities and juvenile justice and adult criminal justice systems.
If medicaid became more fragmented and there were fewer providers this state would see an immediate cost because of lack of outpatient providers an increase in hospitalizations and long term care placements which are both extremely expensive. Ultimately the best thing for children and the system long term is to keep organizations like CCNC, keep medicaid from further fragmenting and enable outpatient providers to give quality care to the children who most need it."
"As a provider in a pediatric practice that is over 55% medicaid, I strongly feel that fragmenting the current system, deleting the cost effective CCNC program (which has been a model for other states),adding additional layers of administration and bureaucracy, financially squeezing those of us in the ""trenches"" and not addressing more effective and appropriate consumer use of the Medicaid program will lead to a recipe for disaster. We need proactive parent education about managing simple childhood illnesses and appropriate use of ERs and offices - maybe CCNC can work with communities to help teach young parents? If we are unable to have people have any buy in/skin in the game with a small copay to help control costs, what about a consumption tax on tattoos (as there is on cigarettes and alcohol) to help fund the program? In a 2 week observation period, 80% of my Medicaid patients' parents had visible tattoos.....radical idea? I think we need to address the precise problems that those of us diagnosing and treating children and families see, not ideas hatched by non-clinical people who see more administrators as they answer to health care problems."
"I work as an Affordable Care Act (ACA) Health Navigator, and my employer is Partnership for Community Care, one of the CNNC networks in North Carolina. I am disappointed that the NC legislature has opted to focus their energies on undermining a proven cost-effective Medicaid program (the CNNC networks); moreover, their refusal to expand Medicaid has hurt economic opportunity in North Carolina and has prevented the ACA from lifting more people out of poverty and connecting them to care. I urge CMS and any other agencies responsible for reviewing North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Demonstration not to allow this proposal to go forward. Thank you for considering this comment."
"I am a pediatrician who serves many children who have Medicaid insurance. In order to have a viable new system, it must:
1) Be easy to use for healthcare providers and offices: there is a potential that my office will have to work with 15 Medicaid companies under the new plan. We will be unable to conform to all the bureaucracy and different rules for 15 different companies. If this is the case, we will likely be forced to choose 1 or 2 that we are willing to work with. This means we will have to turn away children who are covered by the other companies.
2) Focus on fair Medicaid payments: physicians in NC have already endured payment cuts in 2016, if private companies take a percentage of payments, this means payments for physicians may be cut further. We are businesses, too. We cannot pay our staff, nurses, computers, and rent if payments are cut further.
3) Maintain adequate access to care: there is no clear plan set forth on how the network of specialists, access to therapies and other services will be handled within the new Medicaid health plans.
4) Uphold CCNC: CCNC is the only Medicaid-affiliated organization that I work with that provides positive engagement. The organization has a proven track record of cost savings while working collaboratively with physicians and patients. They are genuinely interested in my feedback and suggestions to improve care for Medicaid patients.
5) Be receptive to the feedback of providers and patients: I am discouraged to see that the extensive feedback from the public that was solicited in the NC DHHS Listening Sessions and forums did not translate into substantive revisions in the current waiver application."
I want my representative to vote for MEDICAID EXPANSION-opening benefits up to more should be a priority. It is a smart choice and it should be a priority for all who represent the good of NC. More people insured means reduced non paying visits to ER and timelier healthcare. I wish to acknowledge the great work CCNC is doing across the state. The idea of public/private partnerships working together to provide cooperative and coordinated care through medical home model is working. The process is proven to be successful saving the state millions/billions of dollars. Why recreate the wheel. Change is good but this is a proven program-lets support it.
"I have been a practicing Pediatrician in Moore county for the past 40yrs. I am dismayed and disgusted over the proposed changes to our current Medicaid reimbursement system. It will place practicing Pediatricians in a position where they have to deal with a variety of payers and thus create an unnecessary beurocratic burden. The majority of Pediatricians in North Carolina are extremely pleased with the current CCNC network and one payer system. This system has been recognized by other states as a model which efficiently cares for the needs of the children covered by Medicaid. Pediatricians across the state have risen to the challenge of reducing medical costs by judiciously prescribing medications and expanding their office hours to accommodate their patients in a medical home. These factors alone have dramatically reduced unnecessary ER visits. Over my years in practice I have taken pride in caring for those children most in need of my services. I fear the newly proposed system will drive providers away from the care of Medicaid patients and that will be a travesty.,"
"As a pediatrician who has cared for medicaid patients in North Carolina for the last 20 years, I am extremely worried about the proposed changes. Those changes will take a simple, easy to understand system and replace it with multiple entities, each with different billing, referral, and prescribing rules. The new complexity will put an extreme burden on already stressed primary care practices. The only way for my practice to handle this will be to limit the number of entities we deal with and therefore limit the number of medicaid patients we will be able to see. We are in a rural area, and that will severely limit the options our patients will have. Our current system of community care networks has been a model for the nation and has saved billions since it's inception. The system is known and coverage is simple. We have never had to limit access, and have never been closed to medicaid in the 50 years our practice has existed. That will change under the plan that is proposed. Kids will lose access and will be forced to search for other options. It is a terrible idea."
"The NC waiver proposes to deliver the Medicaid program and most Medicaid recipients to multiple commercial managed care companies and/or to Provider Led Entities that meet health plan fiscal requirements established by the Dept. of Insurance. Community Care of North Carolina has a proven track record in reducing Medicaid utilization and costs. CCNC has built a strong infrastructure of primary care, clinical care management, pharmacy management and information systems. CCNC has the critical community partnerships with social agencies and safety net providers across the entire state to make positive impact on the health of complex Medicaid patients. CCNC's role needs to be expanded (not reduced, as the waiver proposes). CCNC should have more authority and be provided with the same tools that are given to commercial managed care companies to continue to be a national model for managing the care of Medicaid patients."
Expand Medicaid so those who have real needs can receive care. Open your eyes and look at ALL North Carolinians!
"Hi I am a patient under Medicaid, I was switched to Carolina access Medicaid. I was with my obgyn for 15yrs, she only takes Medicaid, she said because Carolina Access paper work billing kept messing up. I never agreed to switch, I don't want to switch Drs. Can I get my regular Medicaid back? They said nothing would change in a report I read, That was not true, some Drs. will not take Carolina Access Medicaid and you have to start the Dr. search all over again. :(:( Guilford Co."
"1) Medicaid must provide a streamlined system for medical practices to use: Reduce bureaucratic hurdles. Our practice cannot deal with 15 different sets of billing and authorization rules.
2) Medicaid must provide for fair, timely payment to healthcare providers: We take caring for children seriously. But we are also a business and we need to be paid fairly and on time to make payroll, buy supplies, make rent-- all the things that it takes to run a business.

"While North Carolina's Medicaid Reform 1115 Demonstration has proposed a major change to the delivery of Medicaid in our state, hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians will remain without access to care under the proposed plan. We urge North Carolina's leaders to expand Medicaid eligibility as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, thus providing essential health care access to more than 300,000 individuals in our state who currently have no other options available to them.

Not only will this improve our state's economy and overall well-being, it is the only decent thing to do."
"NC's hospitals are providing much uncompensated care since the uninsured must go to emergency rooms. This care is very expensive and not ideal for most routine primary care problems. Seeking care in a hospital emergency room is the only place an uninsured patient can get care. NC has not expanded Medicaid to cover a significant number of patients as was planned in the Affordable Care Act. The insurance market does not work if everyone is not covered. I suggest that NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration include expanding Medicaid and closing this gap in coverage.

"The failure by North Carolina to include Medicaid expansion in its reform demonstration is inexplicable and inexcusable.
See below:
Here's an indisputable fact: By closing the Medicaid coverage gap our legislators could prevent more than 1100 deaths in North Carolina each year (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1202099#t=articleTop) and legislators can't plead ignorance because they've been reminded repeatedly, in public. Most of these avoidable deaths occur among the working poor Americans who, without Medicaid, must rely on emergency rooms.

Denied access to lifesaving preventative and follow up care, they die.
Our legislators have certain knowledge that each year they refuse to close the Medicaid gap they will kill about 1100 innocent people and yet they continue to refuse.

Here's my question: How is our legislature's knowingly killing thousands of innocent people by refusing Medicaid expansion different in simple moral terms from a terrorist's walking into a public place and using an assault rifle? Don't the legislature's victims also count?

Thinking of terrorists killing innocent victims in America frightens us. But shouldn't we be more frightened of our legislature? After all, in the years after 9/11/2001, terrorists have killed 94 people in our homeland (http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html ), whereas, by refusing to expand Medicaid, our legislature continues to cause the preventable deaths of 1100 innocent North Carolinians each year. In our name."
"The strength and prosperity of a state begins with the health of its citizens. Research provides evidence that ""childhood Medicaid eligibility significantly improves health, educational, and financial outcomes in adolescence and adulthood.""6 The 2016 North Carolina Child Health Report Card shows that children are healthier if their parents are healthy, and ""when children grow up healthy, we collectively benefit from better educated adults, a healthier workforce, and active and engaged communities.""7
In short: this research found that a parent's access to health care has a direct impact on the health and well-being of their children. Healthy parents are better able to care for their children, and insuring parents provides economic security to families. Additionally, when parents are insured, children are more likely to be insured.
This has a bearing on all North Carolinians. Families and communities thrive when treatment for mental and physical health problems is accessible to everyone. Preventative care frequently averts more serious illnesses that can result in extensive hospital stays, workplace absences, disruption to the family, and even medical bankruptcy"
"Without Medicaid expansion in North Carolina, the reform is meaningless, given that 500,000 people fall in the gap between those currently eligible for Medicaid and those eligible for support through the Affordale Care Act. The senseless refusal, motivated by political spite, already has hurt the delivery of health services at smaller, rural hospitals. The gap keeps these half a million people in a cycle of poverty needing to chose between food, health care, and meeting daily expenses. .....not to mention the economic loss to the state of NC."
"Before you approve any 'reform' to medicaid in NC, please be sure that medicaid expansion is approved for NC. It is estimated that 1/2 million adults in NC fall in the coverage gap and have no health insurance. It is well documented that medicaid expansion would be good for NC economically, but regardless of the economic benefits it is morally wrong (from the perspective of all faiths) to exclude people from health insurance and thus health care because our legislature has refused to expand medicaid.. We must not 'reform' a system and continue to exclude those who would qualify for medicaid were it expanded."

"It is crucial that NC expand Medicaid as part of its reform. The 300,000 working poor depend on it, and the rest of us will benefit from the stimulus to our economy."
"I have grave concerns about the NCDHHS proposal to allow managed care companies to oversee Medicaid services. The administration of the program needs to be entirely managed by the state for the benefit of patients, not for the benefit of any private insurance company. Our governor and legislature have insisted that our Medicaid program was ""broken,"" when in fact it has been a model, award winning program that has been efficiently run.

The most disturbing thing about NC's proposed waiver is the omission of Medicaid expansion. It is inhumane to leave 500,000 people - the majority of whom hold one or more jobs - in the coverage gap, with no possible means of obtaining health insurance. It is inhumane, in a state that has suffered tremendous job loss over the last 2 decades, to decline the 40,000 jobs that Medicaid expansion would create by 2020. It is inhumane to indifferently stand by and watch hospitals in poor, rural communities close, depriving those communities of critical care and major employment. We have already seen a 49 year old mother die of heart failure because her town's hospital closed, and the nearest one was 70 miles away.

Polls have shown that the majority of North Carolinians (in both parties) are in favor of expanding Medicaid, and statewide pressure on our legislators has grown. The legislators in power, however, have boxed themselves in a corner by publically (and legislatively) refusing to cooperate with any aspect of ""Obamacare."" Many believe that the best opportunity to free them from their predicament and allow them to save face would be a CMS response to the waiver that insists on including expansion. Please help our struggling citizens get health care and free us from the recalcitrance of a few, very powerful lawmakers (who may secretly want a way out). Make expansion a condition for approval of any NC Medicaid waiver!

Thank you for accepting and considering the opinions of NC citizens in this matter."

"I was a CAC for the first 2 years the ACA provided the opportunity for so many people to finally obtain health insurance. However, most of the people who came to enrollment events where I worked, and the clinics I was stationed in week after week hoping to enroll fell into the ""Medicaid Gap"". It was heartbreaking to have to explain why they could not get subsidies to buy health insurance. This wrong. Just plain wrong. PLEASE require any Medicaid reform in NC to require Medicaid expansion.

"There are so many problems that we as a society aim to address and fix that sometimes it's hard to know where to begin. Ensuring that all people have equitable access to healthcare is something that we can and must do to prevent many other social ills from developing. Families that can't afford healthcare can quickly go bankrupt if they don't have coverage or leave their health problems untreated, leading to disastrous results for individuals and our public health. Substantial evidence shows the cost is ultimately higher to us all when we don't provide healthcare to all. As a concerned North Carolinian, who has seen how quickly the weight of medical expenses can overwhelm my own middle class family, I urge you to expand coverage to ensure that no one falls through the cracks."
"Dear CMS Representative:
First, thank you for the opportunity to make comments about the Medicaid 1115 waiver for NC. As someone who has spent over 30 years in the commercial health insurance and health plan sectors, I understand first hand how critically important it is to have accessible and affordable health care services available to all Americans. In my view, there is no rationale for limiting health care to the current eligibility categories of Medicaid in NC or to the status of each North Carolinian's personal employment . Unfortunately, our current legislative leadership does not seem swayed by the facts- either the personal stories of their constituents or of the financial impacts of not expanding Medicaid (43,000 jobs lost, $21B lost, etc.). In fact, anything remotely associated with Obama and ObamaCare is rejected wholesale without any coherent rationale. So, in light of the opportunity of the submission of this waiver I ask that you consider a way to incorporate Medicaid expansion into the waiver implementation and include over 500,000 North Carolinans who are currently denied access to Medicaid. When better to expand coverage then as part of the implementation of new provider entities and new ways to deliver care to needy North Carolinians? North Carolina cannot afford to miss this opportunity to enhance the well being of our citizens and boost our state's economy.
Thank you!"
"Dear Friend,

As a navigator for the ACA for the past three years here in NC, I have been in the the very demoralizing position of having to tell more than one potential consumer that s/he did not qualify for financial support for purchasing health insurance because they did not make enough money (even though some of them were working full-time) nor qualify for Medicaid. Therefore, in my mind, the ""reform"" that is being contemplated for Medicaid in NC must include expansion of the benefits.

As you have no doubt already been told, here are some of the costs for not expanding Medicaid:
--1 in 5 adults under 65 remains uninsured in NC
--Not expanding Medicaid is already hindering job creation and economic growth because NC is not capturing billions in federal matching dollars that would otherwise flow into the state economy to make expansion more affordable
--If NC does not expand Medicaid by 2016, $21 billion in federal matching funds will be lost between 2016 and 2020.
--Statewide, about half the jobs not created would be in health care (hospitals and clinics); almost half would be in other sectors such as construction or retail and wholesale trade.
--Small hospitals and clinics have had to close--particularly affecting rural poor.

Non-economic reasons to expand Medicaid:
--When parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured and they are better able to care for their children.
--By not closing the gap, the cycle of poverty and sickness continues. Consequences of families falling into crisis because of a lack of health coverage and a medical crisis include foreclosures and evictions--having to make the decision to pay the rent or pay for much needed medication.

Respectfully,

Leslie Long"
"Expansion of the NC Medicaid program should be the priority of any reform. NC legislators need some reform to justify expansion, and I worry that that they will not voluntarily expand Medicaid after it is ""fixed"" (i.e. the basis of this reform). Please (i) ensure that any reform doesn't fundamentally damage the Medicaid program and its intent and (ii) conditions such reform upon simultaneous expansion. Expansion will benefit the entire NC population."
Expanding Medicaid in North Carolina will help our state morally and economically. Failing to expand Medicaid is both immoral and unwise.
"It is critically important to the state of NC and its citizens that any reform waiver must include Medicaid expansion. As a business man and proud citizen of NC, it embarrasses me that our state leadership has taken such a draconian stance on expansion resulting in additional health hardships on a segment of our population and the working poor."
"I am appalled that NC has not yet decided to save a great deal of money, quite a few lives, and Medicaid coverage for about half a million state residents. As you must know, closing the gap between Medicaid and ACA eligibility levels by expanding Medicaid would take care of this problem---and without so much change to th program, which was working fairly well for those enrolled before all these untested plans were conceived."
"NC needs a more compassionate approach to those of us who need Medicaid. Many of us ""put into"" the system before becoming one who ""needs"" the system. We deserve a respectful response to our requirements for decent living -- to maintain a standard of living that is at least above the poverty level. Personally, I don't know what we would have done over the last year without EBT assistance and Medicaid. I am 61, disabled for over 10 years but before that, I contributed to the work force. My husband suffers debilitating PTSD from a military experience and is in the process of appealing the first rejection of his compensation request. He is considered 100% unemployable by his VA psychiatrist but the system moves slowly. Meanwhile, we are dependent upon Medicaid for me and EBT benefits for us both. Thank you."
"MEDICAID EXPANSION

Dear Reader:

As you work on the waiver for North Carolina, please ensure that the requirements for the Medicaid Expansion be included. There are the humane reasons for doing this such as reducing the preventable deaths from the group of nearly one-half million people who are not covered by the Affordable Care Act. Also, 27,000 people in this gap who have diabetes and are not getting treated.

The diabetes problem is a lead into the positive economic impact including Medicaid Expansion would have. Some inancial incentives and considerations follow:
• Management of diabetes saves later extreme costs of late-stage diabetes treatment
• ""Since January 1, 2014 NC has rejected $4.9 million per day.""
• ""Take the Money – don't leave $15 billion on the table.""
• ""Keep NC tax dollars here in NC.""
• ""Expanding Medicaid is good for NC businesses including hospitals.""
• ""Insuring half a million North Carolinians is cost effective and humane.""

Recently, I volunteered at a Community Health Center where a woman who was eight-months pregnant came in. She did not know how to get medical attention. The Health Center was not able to help her. We need a health system that covers everyone. We cannot have gaps where diseases are not treated, where prevention is not emphasized, and where strong economic practices are not embraced."
"Expanding the ability of people to access Medicaid will benefit families who currently have no access to essential health care. In addition to enabling them to lead healthier lives, it will help their family finances a well as the local economies where they live. Therefore I urge our lawmakers to expand Medicaid to include those in the ""gap,"" as so many other states have done!"
I believe NC Medicaid Reform will best be served by the inclusion of Medicaid Expansion
Please expand Medicaid especially in NC. I still patients that clearly qualify for services but may miss the budget guidelines by a few dollars. They go without care and increase costs down the line.
"However, we remain deeply concerned that the fundamental model will reduce access of children to health by increasing administrative barriers and exacerbating payment concerns for pediatric providers. We are also concerned about how the number of outstanding issues will be resolved, including details on how administrative ease will be assured, payment levels, structure and payment of telehealth, network adequacy, Chapter 58 protections and other factors.
How these ""details"" are resolved will have a substantial impact on the ability of pediatricians to keep practicing and to continue to serve publicly insured children. Since the vast majority of people with health insurance through Medicaid and Health Choice are under age 21, Medicaid reform won't work if it doesn't work for children and the professionals who care for them.
The consequences are substantial for children who are mostly healthy. The potential impact is even more significant for children and youth with special health care needs, those who have experienced trauma, those with mental and behavioral health needs and teens transitioning into adult care."
"Medicaid should be completely funded for the health and safety of the children of NC. If you need to save money, require mothers of Medicaid recipients to have birth control placed to limit additional children and offer reduced cost or free quality day care so mother's can continue their education or learn a trade to attempt to get off public support. I also think it is reasonable to only cover a child for the first 5 years of life and not cover subsequent children while the first child is covered. This will keep Medicaid from becoming a way of life. It was always intended as a leg up not a life style."
"If these reforms take place I can assure you that our practice will start limiting the amount of Medicaid we take. The reimbursements are already terrible for pediatrics and in order to break even our patient load has had to steadily increase, which in turn makes it so that we do not have enough time to give patients the care they deserve. Also, having an outcome based system is insanity as far as pediatrics is concerned-no matter what we do, how much counseling we give, the patient population is allowed to abuse their Medicaid and come in for things like a single insect bite or a single day of runny nose. They are allowed to use the system for senseless reasons, and then still continue to use the ER. We need to put restraints on patient's usage, not put more things in the way of the providers."
"As a pediatrician in private practice in North Carolina, I care daily for children with Medicaid. The current system, Community Care for North Carolina, CCNC, has been an exemplary system, providing care for NC children under a provider- run system. The proposed changes to NC Medicaid, including change to for- profit MCOs, will damage and weaken our ability to care for our patients, increase costs and difficulty in providing care. Private practices cannot afford the resources needed to deal with a more complicated, multi- MCO system with different sets of rules and payment methods.

Please allow the current CCNC system to continue it's good work, so we can care for our patients."
"As a Medicaid Reform plan is formulated, I think it is very important that closing the coverage gap be included in a new plan. The federal government has offered us a path to helping up to half a million of NC's most vulnerable citizens have access to health care, and yet we persist in sending our federal tax dollars elsewhere. This is not the kind of state we want to be. Further, a majority of North Carolinians support closing the gap, as most other states have done by now. Even the wealthiest among us cannot support lowering taxes at the expense of those who are struggling the most. No one is immune to catastrophic health incidents, but they are more catastrophic to those who cannot afford health care. Many of these folks are working, but they are the working poor. They are the caretakers for our elderly parents, daycare workers caring for our children, maids in the hotels where we vacation. More importantly, many of these individuals are children who have no control over the wealth of the family they are born into. We say we want the best opportunity for every child in NC, but we withhold federal dollars that could help them. From a strict financial standpoint, many states have already shown that there is financial gain to closing the gap. Those gains are evident at every level from local government to state benefits. We have that data...we are not charting new territory here. There are many excuses for not closing this gap, but they are not authentic ones. The data show unequivocally that there are many layers of benefits from such action. I urge policymakers to follow the facts and use not just their heads but also their hearts to help those who need it most."
"We at Salisbury Pediatrics have been taking care of Medicaid children since our inception over 50 years ago. We are an 18 provider pediatric practice that has prided ourselves on caring for all North Carolinians. The recent Medicaid cuts and current rates are making it difficult to run a practice and continue to care for Medicaid children. We will seriously consider changing our Medicaid enrollment numbers and having these children use urgent and ER care at a much higher cost and with less quality.

It is unconscionable that our services are not worth at least Medicare rates let alone commercial insurance for the same service provided. In order to continue to care for the children of this state, we are asking the government to equalize Medicaid rates to Medicare. This is what is right and just.

We love the kids of this state and hope to continue to provide for them for another 50 years.

"We have continually seen the managed care Medicaid model fail to ensure high quality healthcare to poor people. In NC we already have a successful provider-led model in CCNC that has proven to save the state money as well as provide high quality healthcare. Other states have tried to emulate. It is a NC business that has been built from the ground up. It is innovative and futuristic. Managed care is old news - let's keep our successful system in place and forget this politically-driven crappy proposal to ruin our enviable Medicaid program. CCNC is good for patients, providers, and tax payers."
"I'm the pediatrician in North Carolina, my practice population is approximately 40% Medicaid. Even though the current system is not perfect, it is much better than the proposed changes CMS has made. To try and go to a capitated model would be a disaster for North Carolina's pediatric Medicaid population.
Please don't allow North Carolina's kids to suffer because the state has problems managing the adult Medicaid population."
"Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the 1115 Waiver submitted by the North Carolina DHHS. I have read and agree with the majority of comments which have been made to date especially those which support CCNC and Medicaid expansion for NC. Having practiced pediatrics in NC for almost 40 years I have seen the access problems which existed for the Medicaid patient prior to CCNC. Because of the complexity of the proposed system of 15 different payers and the for-profit nature of commercial MCO's I fear that pediatric offices will op out or decrease the panel size of the Medicaid patient.This will create access issues and end up sending more Medicaid patients to the ER's, increased hospital admissions and readmission's with the resultant increase in cost to both the State and Federal governments, i.e. the tax payers. To do away with CCNC, as the 1115 waver does, is doing a grave disservice to our patients, our providers, and to the tax payers. I urge the officials at CMS to reject NC's bid for the 1115 waver as it is presently written."
"As a pediatrician, I can only say that this is going to be a disaster. Multiple providers of medicaid services with multiple rules, drug lists, preauthorization rules, reimbursements, etc. Medicaid is already one of the most cumbersome insurance providers to deal with and this will only make it worse. Medicaid has the lowest reimbursement already and now you guys plan to add layers of hassle and complexity.

Let me give you an example, currently medicaid has a preferred drug list. This is designed to save millions of dollars for the state every year. As a practicing physician, how do I know what medications are on the PDL? Is my EMR interfaced with the PDL like with other insurance companies? No. Do I have an app on my phone like with other insurance companies? No. Is the PDL constantly updates, so that I always know when a change has been made to the PDL? No. We are talking about a multimillion dollar list here. So how is this information made available to me? There is a PDF file I can download off the internet to my laptop. Then I can use the ""find"" feature in Adobe acrobat to try and search for certain medication within this PDF file. How do I find out when a medication has been added or removed from the PDL? I try to prescribe a medication and the pharmacy or patient calls my office and says ""medicaid will not pay for it."" What? The PDL says it is preferred. ""No, apparently that changed last month, Doc."" Great. I guess I need to go download a new copy of the medicaid PDL PDF file. This is medicaid in 2016. Bush league. Now we are going to cut it into a bunch of pieced and what is going to emerge is going to be more successful? Ha. You guys are great.


Providers are simply going to walk away from medicaid and you are going to hurt the patients, mostly children, by decreasing their access to healthcare. Sure, you will tell us we are going to be paid more due to all the cost savings. Please, don't pee on our backs and tell us it's raining."
"I grew up in California, spent 7 years in Nebraska going to school and have been in North Carolina for twenty years. I have watched multiple variations of insurance-directed Medicaid tried and fail all across the country. North Carolina has been blessed with an effective and cost-effective system for many years. It is sad to me that out governor would dismantle that system and put that money in the pockets of private insurance companies. The biggest sufferers will be the children who are served by NC Medicaid.
I am a proud partner in a 50 year old practice of primary care pediatrics in a suburban clinic. We are 65% Medicaid and are glad to serve this community. If North Carolina is allowed this waiver, this system, like so many before it will fail to serve the most needy. Please stop this disaster in the making.

"NC's Medicaid program has been the envy of nation. It does not need to be overhauled it just needs to be funded appropriately. I have worked in NC for 30 years and was in private practice when Managed Care came in as PCP and Maxicare. Neither program succeeded because of too much administration. Paying someone else to manage medicaid means less money for providers and therefore less access for patients. Providers can't cover costs now with medicaid payments, this proposal will make it worse."
Please make Medicaid expansion an expectation of waiver approval.
"The current NC Medicaid program is not going to benefit from the proposed changes. Having multiple options, each with potentially different regulations, will already only confound administration of the program."
It is unconscienable to deprive a half million poor people healthcare that the Fed has offered to fund.

The latter would add more bureaucratic interfaces for already burdened physician practices, increasing the cost and frustrations of providing care to an already sicker, poorer group for whose care they are either not reimbursed or are paid at a very low level. That would result in fewer physicians accepting fewer patients in this category. We very much, however, need expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina, and that has been rejected by the current General Assembly and governor of our state. The use of the word ""reform"" by this legislation implies that better things are coming; the facts speak otherwise and in my opinion this is just one more manifestation of a far-right political agenda, not in the interests of the poor which it purports to serve, but to enrich those who already are doing well. Please reject this so-called ""reform."""
"My pediatric practice has 55% Medicaid which is over 25,000 Medicaid patients. One in 5 children under the age of 18 have a mental health problem in NC, and with Medicaid that figure is higher. Over 60% of black males are not graduating from High School. 70% of black males that do not graduate from High School will be arrested; at the cost of $50,000 per year to our state. 3,000 kids do not graduate, times $50,000 is $150 MILLION !!! Get a life! Does anyone not understand what is going on? I am having my Medicaid cut 25%, now you want further cuts. I care for over 5,000 Medicaid patients with ADHD and ADHD + Mental comorbidity. My success rate is over 84% go to A/B Honor roll! So why not continue to make cuts, why not continue to have a system that does not reward physicians who care for these patients, who out of pocket pay for educators within my office, why not put over $1 Billion into an intensive home program where a non medical person can make a diagnosis of ADHD / Bipolar disorder and then an agency can receive $100 per hour to give assistance with non college trained individuals to include going to movies, baby sitting, etc. without any accountability -- if you do not believe look on the web site for accountability!! And now you want to disband the CCNC program that at the very least has given medical care to these people fighting for survival. How about throwing a few dollars to physicians who care for the mental health side, and by the way, we have less mental health beds in NC than we did 20 years ago, major shortage of psychiatrists, NC has 27 counties without a psychiatrist, and to my knowledge, we now have more people. Just a thought!"
"As Medicaid considers North Carolina's application for a waiver to Medicaid participation requirements, Medicaid must require expansion by the state to close the coverage gap before the state's reform plan is approved. It is obvious that many health, social and economic benefits would follow expansion. Hundreds of thousands of NC residents need the basic health care that Medicaid expansion would provide. Rural hospitals need the revenue to keep open to serve all citizens in the area, not just those on Medicaid.
Health care for low income citizens left out of coverage by the Affordable Care Act has improved in those states that expanded Medicaid participation. With such positive outcomes already known, Medicaid has a duty to insist on expanded coverage in North Carolina.

"I am a pediatric ophthalmologist who has practiced in the State of North Carolina for the last 13 years. My practice cares for a large population of children insured under NC Medicaid.

Allowing out of state, for-profit entities to administer the NC Medicaid program would not serve the interests of the people of North Carolina. This arrangement has been utilized in other states with less than great success. These companies (with deep pockets and significant political influence) demand profitability. These profits funds must come from decreasing reimbursements to hospitals and health care providers in such a scenario, as state funding would be set.

While contracting with for-profit entities would make budgeting easier (and ostensibly more stable), if the for-profit entities do not realize the profitability they seek, they will simply opt out of contract renewal and leave the state. It is my understanding that this has happened in a number of states across the country and has left these states ""in the lurch"".

North Carolina has a better solution already in place.

Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) has become a model for the country with proven cost savings realized through medically sound initiatives that have saved the State of North Carolina millions of dollars. By the governor's own admission, NC Medicaid has run in the black for the past two years WITHOUT the need to have for-profit entities administer the NC Medicaid program.

As demands for medical services increases and funding them becomes increasingly difficult, we must carefully consider how our resources are allocated. These financial resources must be targeted as directly as possible to the actual patient care, not corporate profitability.

"As a provider in a rural, poor area of the state, these changes are very concerning. A multi payer system often leads to more administrative expense, which may pull already sparse resources from patient care. Furthermore, pending expense, a practice such as mine that depends upon efficient reimbursement may not be able to sustain any delays or added overhead. Thus, forcing my practice discontinue acceptance of Medicaid and likely shut down as we are 75% medicaid. We are the only practice in a 15-20 mile radius and our community would suffer."
"I ask you to respect and protect the health of all North Carolinians for some of the following reasons:

(1) 1 in 5 adults under 65 remains uninsured in NC (around 500,000)
(2) We are already hindering job creation and economic growth because NC is not capturing billions in federal matching dollars that would otherwise flow into the state economy to make expansion more affordable.
(3) If NC does not expand Medicaid by 2016, $21 billion in federal matching funds will be lost between 2016 and 2020.
(4) Statewide, about half the jobs not created would be in health care (hospitals and clinics); almost half would be in other sectors such as construction or retail and wholesale trade. NC needs these jobs."
"I am a pediatrician who serves a population that is 65% medicaid. The proposed changes will be a disaster for the pediatric medicaid population. Creating a larger bureaucracy will not save money. Unfortunately, those in government don't seem to get this. Creating more layers of complexity, redundancy, salaries, employees, will not save money under the guise of ""competition"". Until reform is made in which the primary shareholder (the patient/family) has a vested interested in cost containment, medicaid will continue to falter. There needs to be positive and negative incentives to how the patients/families spend the medicaid dollars. Until then, medicaid dollars will be viewed a ""free"". When it is free, it is so easy to go to the ED at 2 in the morning and drive up a 6 thousand dollar bill for what could be handled for $80 dollars in my office the next morning. Until lawmakers understand this, you are not going to be able to legislate your way out of a wet paper sack."
"I am a pediatrician serving a rural area, but am leaving for a more urban/less Medicaid weighted practice because of the possible change in NC Medicaid. Our practice is 55% Medicaid. We barely make ends meet and are bare bones now. The current Medicaid system in North Carolina has been extremely effective in delivering quality care and cost effectiveness/savings as has been well documented. It has been heralded as a model for the nation. It seems absurd for the state to step back and reverse progress. The previous trial with private insurance (for profit) running Medicaid in Mecklenburg County was a total failure. This change will be a mistake and harm the patients served by North Carolina Medicaid."
"I am a pediatrician and more than 90% of the patients in my practice utilize medicaid. PLEASE remember that more than 70% of Medicaid Recipients are children who require comprehensive care to support their growth and development. Please make the following priorities in Medicaid reform:

- Adding 15 different health plans to bill to, get prior authorizations from, utilize formularies for, and communicate will add SIGNIFICANT stress and cost to pediatric practices

- Pediatricians offices already operate at a lower margin than most medical offices – you MUST preserve adequate reimbursement, particularly with the added cost of the PHPs

- Children cannot coordinate their own care and often their families are unable to coordinate care for numerous reasons – PLEASE make care coordination services A PRIORITY.

- The only way we can continue to improve quality of care and control costs is through quality improvement research which relies on comprehensive and easy to utilize data. Preserving strong analytics is essential in allowing Medicaid providers to continue to improve the care we provide for our patients while controlling costs and improving quality.

CC4C was a model in care coordination, support for pediatricians offices, and data analytics. PLEASE work to preserve this centralized service in Medicaid reform."
"PLEASE EXPAND MEDICAID IN NORTH CAROLINA!!! I for one fell through the cracks with ACA....living on a limited income, and disabled. I can no longer afford 700+/month for health insurance. Let's take care of our own citizens first, before sending money elsewhere."
"Please see attached comments from Western North Carolina Community Health Services, Inc."
"I am a retired pediatrician who practiced in rural N.C. for 35 years. Our practice served thousands of children covered by Medicaid. The proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration would be a disaster for the children of North Carolina and would ultimately make it impossible for pediatricians in private practice to care for children on Medicaid--thus throwing these children into understaffed health dept. clinics and expensive ERs. Poor children deserve the same high standard of care given to children born in more fortunate circumstances. This will not be possible under the Medicaid ""Reform"" Demonstration as currently proposed."
The NC request for a 1115 waiver should NOT be approved unless NC expands eligibility for Medicaid to all who do not qualify for ACA or Medicare coverage.
I am greatly concerned about the real impact this will have on the children of North Carolina. As a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner I worry that children will loose access to care. Our current model serves our children well. Dismantling North Carolina Medicaid in incomprehensible. The failure of other state private models (TennCare anyone) should remind us of the pitfalls of this model.
"Everyone should have access to health coverage by closing the Coverage Gap. It's just the right thing to do. Can we do something for the human race and not because of greed, just once? Please?"
"I am a pediatrician practicing over 30 years in NC.
The Medicaid system in NC, run by Community Care of NC (CCNC) has been a model of care delivery that has received national recognition. CCNC has saved the state millions of dollars. It has been budget neutral despite having much greater enrollment. It has provided untold number of kids a ""Medical Home"" where providers expert in the care of children, pediatricians, family practice doctors, physicians' assistants and nurse practitioners can provide continuity of medical care. It ensures that kids get needed preventive health care, immunizations, and coordinated care of both episodic and chronic illness in one place. This prevents needless use of the Emergency Department as a place of care for routine problems, and needless use of subspecialists, when the same care can be provided in the Medical Home for significantly less money. The waiver is to replace a system with low overhead with many different outside, for profit entities. This will force medical providers to deal with multiple different rules, regulations and payment systems. To make this system work, there will need to be money saved to pay the management entities. The only sources of this money would be to a) limit the types of services provided
b) limit the number of people eligible to receive services and c) limit the payment for these services to the providers. Children receiving Medicaid benefits typically have more medical needs. To limit the number of kids entitled to these benefits, and to cut the scope of what is covered would cause significant harm to our most vulnerable population. This could potentially prevent these kids from coming off Medicaid because of chronic disabilities that developed and could have been prevented. Reducing payments to providers can only drive many to stop taking Medicaid, limiting the availability of providers. NC Medicaid pays less than Medicare rates. At a minimum, Medicaid must pay at least as much as Medicare. Lower payments will drive providers to stop taking Medicaid. And in parts of the state where a practice may be 65+% Medicaid, payment cuts can be disastrous. Just because a medical service is covered doesn't mean patients have access to that service.

Our current Medicaid system is functioning well. It is partisan politics that is driving this waiver. I would urge you not to approve these changes."
"North Carolina must expand Medicaid, but the system is so wrecked by the current administration that I would not recommend allowing that administration to do reforms."
"I am a pediatrician practicing in Asheville and I have serious reservations about the proposed Medicaid reform. Having to deal with 5 different MCO's will increase time and money my office has to spend on each patient. My partners and I anticipate that we will be compensated less than before (which is disheartening since Medicaid rates have been flat for over ten years - not even keeping up with cost of living). Due to the loss of income and increase in time spent dealing with multiple MCOs, I believe it likely, that my practice will be unable to take on new Medicaid patients and further, that we may possibly be forced to stop seeing current Medicaid patients. It is not fair for the children of NC to have more barriers to care placed upon them. I would hope that this proposal be reconsidered. At the least, I would hope that it be rolled out in phases, where it is piloted in the less vulnerable adult Medicaid population and only be considered for children after a long and successful pilot phase."
"Please, North Carolina, expand health care services to those who, in many cases, can least afford what they desperately need. Reach out, North Carolina, and help your fellow citizens in need."
"As a primary health care provider in North Carolina, I strongly urge that North Carolina's Medicaid reform include expansion of Medicaid (new enrollment) to include those individuals currently ""caught in the gap"" and unable to receive benefits of the Affordable Care Act.
I also object to the capitated payment structure, corporate for-profit management, competing networks with overlapping, wasteful bureaucaries, and to the dismantling of the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina's non-profit provider-led networks."
"""I am a pediatric nurse practitioner working in rural NC. I have lived and worked here for over 17 years and have great respect for our Community Care of NC Medicaid program.

I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services.

The practice's support of the behavioral health needs of their patients and families is outstanding and exemplary. We have experienced significant success treating the psychiatric, emotional, social, cognitive, academic and familial needs of our patients through the complex integration of Pediatric Primary Care and Behavioral Health Care. This is achieved through the current model of NC Medicaid and would absolutely be deteriorated and unable to be supported through the proposed changes.

The mental health care of the Pediatric population and their families is a regional, state, and National epidemic issue which requires integrity and commitment to the proper allocation of resources. This has been judiciously achieved with the support of Community Care of NC Medicaid Program. This will not be possible given the proposed changes. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services.

"As a physician, it pains me to see the effects of North Carolina legislature's willful limitation of health care to its citizens."
"I am a Nurse Practitioner and work at a free clinic in NC where we see over 6000 people in just one county who would almost all have Medicaid if we had accepted the expansion. In a country this rich we should not have to have free clinics in order for people to get some care. Without us, they would all be in Emergency rooms with huge costs of care, and they would not have Primary Care to manage their Diabetes, Hypertension and cholesterol. If we can control these it will save lives and costs"
"I am really not optimistic about the proposed changes to the medicaid system. I serve a large medicaid population and will need to decrease the amount of medicaid patients I see if the medicaid system becomes too complex and burdensome. I know you guys are going to tell me that I am going to make more money because of all the cost savings, but lets be realistic, we all know that is not going to happen.

If you guys want to save money, make the current system more efficient. For example, improve the PDL. Make the information more accessible to physicians like the other big boy insurance companies do. The current PDL has 5 medications ""preferred"" for the treatment of lice. I have no idea which is most cost effective for the medicaid system. I know that some of the ""preferred"" treatments can cost over $200 for a treatment, but I have no idea how much it actually cost medicaid. If medicaid gave me an idea as to which is most cost effective, I would surely prescribe that one. Pretty simple concept, right? No need to nuke the whole system and hope the reconstruction will be better."
"As a primary care physician who has lived and practiced in North Carolina for 34 years and who has provided care to the uninsured for all of that time, the NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration waiver request is deeply flawed for the following reasons:

2. Corporate, for-profit management which increases administrative costs

"The refusal to expand Medicaid amounts to an abdication of the duty to serve the people of North Carolina. People who do not have health insurance die prematurely. It is that simple.

I have practiced medicine in North Carolina since 1988. I am appalled that our government officials are so callous. Shouting that ""Medicaid is broken"" is not an excuse; it is a cop out!

We have the ability to improve the lives of more than 350,000 North Carolinians by expanding Medicaid. Ninety percent of the costs will be paid by the federal government. North Carolina will recoup any expenses by increased tax revenue and increased jobs that will come with expanding Medicaid.

"I am a general pediatrician practicing in rural NC for 20+ years. NC Medicaid WORKS there is no logical or sane reason to change a program that currently functions with a 6% administrative overhead to multiple entities who are ""allowed"" to have 12% administrative cost or more. Most pediatric practices in NC have 20-80% Medicaid patients. This change would restrict access by reducing the amount of providers who accept ""new"" Medicaid. This would shift care to more costly ERs and away from well established medical homes. This plan would be bad for children and their families, and would result in more costly, fragmented care for NC's most vulnerable citizens."
"As a pediatrician with over 15 years experience in the state, I am profoundly concerned by the proposed waiver. Medicaid cuts have already left our practice as the only one in all of southeastern North Carolina accepting new patients with Medicaid. Anything that increases our overhead, such as dealing with a potential 15 different payers just for Medicaid, or increases the complexity of our care, such as complying with 15 different sets of care guidelines, threatens our continued viability.

I also must emphasize that Pediatrics is a statewide practice, not a regional one. The waiver as constructed threatens to leave us nowhere to send children with orthopedic issues, genetic diseases, or complex congenital heart disease, as all these conditions require referral to the academic medical centers clustered in the central part of the state. Likewise, children and young families are highly mobile, and the regional networks threaten our ability to care for children who move from Greensboro or Asheville and need care immediately upon arriving in Wilmington.

One of the mandates of the Medicaid program is to provide accessible care to its recipients, most of whom are children. This waiver, if implemented as written, virtually guarantees the failure of that mandate. I am happy to speak further or answer any questions.

"NC Medicaid reform is an absolute terrible idea. North Carolina Medicaid expansion is NEEDED. A reform will reduce care availability, as well as compliance due to different issue; Mainly the issue of transportation. A medicaid reform will reduce and cut jobs for many individuals across North Carolina. Medicaid Reform will eliminate Patient Centered Medical Homes and create Person Center Health Communities. This will create over populated Health Communities and greatly reduce the quality of care that patients currently receive at PCMH facilities. By expanding Medicaid in this state it will allow providers to continue to grow as companies and build in the rural communities that is falsely believed to benefit from North Carolina Medicaid reform. Many providers now participate in PCMH programs that allow them to track and follow up with all patients needing and receiving current care. A Medicaid reform will restrict patients' choices and voice in choosing their medical provider which will reduce patient compliance. A medicaid reform for the state of North Carolina is not needed; A MEDICAID EXPANSION IS!!"

"As an employee that works for a federally qualified health center I think that Medicaid expansion is crucial. As a certified application counselor I assist consumers with the health insurance market place application daily. The hardest part of my job is having to tell them that they don't qualify for financial assistance because they don't make enough money. ""It sounds like crazy talk"" said Tasha a recent consumer that I assisted. ""I think that people should be able to access any level of care from primary to specialty"" said Carol another consumer that I recently assisted who was not eligible for subsidies.

In order to help ensure their health, they need health insurance so they can keep up with their health and take all preventive measures to stay healthy.

The fact that they are working should be a qualifying not a disqualifying factor in consideration as to their eligibility. Let's not encourage laziness. They are trying to improve their lives and should not be disqualified from eligibility. If non working adults with children qualify, what incentive would a hard working individual struggling to make ends meet have to continue working? We need a productive workforce!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program continue to leave out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"

"I represent a pediatric practice seeing patients from the poorest county within the state. More than half of our patients are insured by Medicaid. To consider not expanding Medicaid will most certainly and detrimentally affect our bottom line but will, unfortunately, have the greatest impact upon our kids and our families. It would seem many decisions regarding proposed change have been isolated to budgetary concerns and a response to private parties lobbying for change. The current system is not perfect or without opportunities for improvement...but it does work. The stage is being set for corporate entities to benefit at the expense of our kids. As they rake their overhead portion of the management fee, proposed reimbursement will inevitably be reduced leaving providers with few options but referral to urgent and emergency care, ultimately affecting the quality of care.

The current system is efficient and streamlined enough to manage the patient's care. However, with the addition of multiple entities, with varying practices and procedures and a for-profit mindset, to manage the patient through each stage of care, seemingly will create chaos and ultimately affect the timeliness and quality of care we all strive to provide.

"I oppose NC being issued a waiver and hope that the request should be denied.

As a long term resident of NC with multiple generations of my family living and working in NC, I do not think the proposed changes are in the best interest of of North Carolina's citizens and will degrade the quality of health care available.

"Medicaid is a hugely important service in NC. My daughter, age 55, although she worked for many years, is now unable.
The treatment she receives from Medicaid allows her to live alone and function in society. Please consider human beings when you consider ""reforms"""

North Carolina citizens would profoundly benefit from Medicaid expansion. Thank you for your consideration.
"It is vitally important that all people have access to healthcare. Currently, the lack of participation in the Medicaid expansion is unacceptable. As someone who works in healthcare, it is so sad to see people who are unable to afford care and end up in an ER because they have no other choice. We must do something about this, everyone needs access to care."
"As a Federally Qualified Health Center provider, I work at a local homeless shelter, where folks with families, from many walks of life living paycheck to paycheck, end up losing a job that means losing all their supports, including health care services .. many of these folks have no idea of what is available to them, if only Medicaid was available ..

Deserving people deserve proper health care ..."
"My practice is one of the highest Medicaid volume practices in the Charlotte metro area. If the current proposal goes through, we will be forced to close to new Medicaid patients at a minimum. It is very likely we could withdraw from the program all together, thus forcing thousands of patients to find a new provider. Ethically, I have a serious problem with this situation. CCNC has proven it's value over the years. NC has lead the country in Medicaid metrics in the past. I fear this will be lost with the new proposal. Most importantly, I think we will create serious problems in caring for pediatric patients by applying the same policies and reforms to all ages of Medicaid recipients. The highest cost, and thus higher ROI for reform, is by starting with the adult population. Don't sacrifice the health of our children by applying the same broad stroke, one size fits all, methodology to all Medicaid recipients. At a minimum, a staged implementation for reform, with pediatrics being last, would be the most sensible compromise. In short, I feel the current proposal is short sighted and will be low value (high cost, low quality) in the future. The legislature has to understand that a program which does not meaningfully engage physicians and providers, thus having our support, is doomed to fail! We can't afford it financially. We can't afford it ethically. Policymakers, as well as providers, are in positions of influence and privilege. We owe our fellow North Carolinians a better path forward that what is currently proposed."
"I oppose NC's Medicaid Reform because it does not include accepting the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and will thus leave many of the working poor without any coverage, it will restrict care and increase costs and wasteful bureaucracies, and it will dismantle the very successful provider-led Community Care of NC,"
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program continue to leave out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"
"As a physician I have cared for patients with malignancies and no insurance. This had been extremely difficult for patients most often leading to a delay in diagnosis with more advanced disease and more debilitated patients before any treatment can be begun. My personal experience mirrors national data demonstrating inferior outcomes and higher death rates. On more than one occasion I have had patients decline any therapy concerned that they may bankrupt their families. It is morally unacceptable to deny coverage to 300,000 folks in NC who have no other health coverage options, those who fall into the gap below 100% of the federal poverty limit. Best estimates are that it would cost the state less than $1000/patient to provide them with excellent medical coverage (total cost less than $300 million when all costs and increased state revenues are considered). In a state budget of $22.7 billion with $2 billion in tax breaks given in recent years it is not only unreasonable but unethical to leave the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens without acceptable life saving care. Expand Medicaid as per the ACA - there have rarely been such cost beneficial legislation as this in our state and no risk that costs will go up; several states have already passed co-legislation that if the state percentage is raised above 10% their states will no longer participate. Richard Foulke, MD"
North Carolina's medicaid system is a disgrace. MANY lost access to healthcare as a result of NC not expanding the program. MANY who can't afford to pay for the joke of 'affordable healthcare' have declined in health due to the inability to afford healthcare or insurance. I can't believe that our state has so many who have 'fallen through the cracks' due to this. Does our state truly care that little for it's residents that it allows the poor and sick to suffer. It's disgusting.
"One of my dear patients just died. He was 55. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C over 10 years ago, and although he worked hard physical jobs, he was never provided insurance and his income was too low to qualify for ACA. Thus, he refused referral for treatment, as he knew he would be unable to pay. He died of a liver cancer that was caused by his untreated hep C infection, an infection that is curable. This was a tragic and unnecessary death, directly linked to NC's failure to expand Medicaid."

I am a Pediatric Surgical Specialist trained to manage complicated congenital defects in children. At present the NC Medicaid single system allows children throughout the state to be seen by me without significant difficulty to them. It works very well. Multiple plans throughout the state will block or make it very difficult for the children to get in to see a specialist if they are not available in that part of the state. There are a limited number of pediatric surgical specialist in the state.
"I have been a pediatrician in rural NC for 25 years and our 6 providers and 40 staff take care of over 10,000 patients and about 60% are on medicaid. The proposed changes are a huge threat to our ability to continue to provide medical care to these children, many of whom have chronic serious medical problems. The current system in NC, the Community Care of NC network has been successful in a state wide, uniform effort to reduce cost and improve quality. The proposed complex, for-profit plan is far more complicated, creates a new level of bureaucracy and puts the children of our state at the mercy of a non physician led collection of insurance entities that will compete in a race for the bottom line. We simply cannot exist in that environment. We are barely hanging on financially with the most recent cuts in medicaid reimbursement, We are open 7 days a week and evenings. The thought of dealing with multiple insurance companies instead of the one entity we have now will be the final straw. Our practice may simply collapse, as young physicians leave, enormous gaps open in cash flow, and senior doctors simply quit in disgust. Please reconsider this ill advised proposal."
The present NC Medicaid system functions well. I am a health care professional who cares for Medicaid children in NC. The complexity of a new system with potentially 12-15 areas throughout the state will make the administrative assistance I can provide to my patients almost impossible and financially untenable.
"Our practice, after 35 years serving the poorest children here in rural North Carolina, has never face such a threat as the 1115 waver. CCNC has worked. A complex network of for profit companies with a 15% over head that will come out of the already underfunded medicaid provider networks will be the last straw. Stop this outrageous maneuver to put more money in the pockets of insurance companies and undermine our ability to care for these kids!!!"
"Our practice provides service for young children with Medicaid and if the CCNC was to be ended and for profit MCO would take over, it would make it impossible to continue the excellent care we provide.

"I am a pediatric subspecialist in North Carolina, who has been in practice for 20 years. Over 50% of my practice is Medicaid based. I see over 2500 patients per year. CCNC in North Carolina has been excellent for my patients, in terms of access to care, quality of care, and value to our state ( 6% administrative overhead).

I have had experience in other states with managed Medicaid, and it was a disaster for patient care. I would go so far as to say that it was abusive to patients, and fiscally punitive to providers. The medical office staff were sent running in circles to try to care for our patients. If the waiver goes through I will not take Medicaid."
"Do not allow managed care organizations take over CCNC, which is doing an amazing job in NC of taking care of children.

Pediatrician in Raleigh ,NC"
CCNC has done a fine job. Keep sick children out of emergency rooms by supporting this primary care network. Many practices will withdraw from medicaid if 1115 goes through. The current waver proposal creates an enormous bureaucratic mess that is totally unnecessary.
"If Medicaid Reform goes through, it will be very difficult for the children in need for specialized care to find a specialist that will take their specific MCO or PLE. This will delay or make it impossible for them to get the care they need. We are strongly against removing CCNC.

"I have witnessed an MCO transition in GA and I know first hand how restrictive it was for children who were in need for care. We can not allow this to happen to our children here in NC!

"I want to voice my opinion that the North Carolina Medicaid waiver is bad for children in our state. I practiced in Detroit as a pediatric urologist prior to moving to North Carolina, where I witnessed two of four managed care organizations go bankrupt, and with it, any semblance of care vanished. I think the Medicaid waiver will cost more and have less value than the current system."
"Our PCMH Certified Pediatric Office tries to provide the highest standard of care including breast feeding consultation and giving primary care to spanish speaking families in their own language. We have never said ""no"" to a child who has Medicaid and in need for a Pediatrician, however if the current system will be overhauled and for profit MCO's will take over , I don't believe we can accept any new patients who will have MCO as their insurance. Other Pediatricians I've been in touch with are thinking similarly.

This will translate to sick children with no primary care providers and they will flood the Emergency Room's and create an environment that we are trying to avoid.

Please reach out and listen to the Pediatricians before making a legislative decision about this. Thank you.

"Uninsured men and women 45-65 are discriminated against in NC by either not allowing or making it hard for them to receive medicaid. Many of them have chronic illness and are ill-served in free clinics. Working in a community health center (Piedmont Health Services) I see many people who cannot afford the minimum $25 fee to come in regularly, can't afford their multiple medicines, even though we discount them heavily and go without for months. It is financially out of the question to try to get a procedure or specialty consultation done outside our facility. Many have a car and some have a house, making them ineligible for medicaid, yet they are quite cash deficient. ""Charity care"" at UNC is helpful, but the waiting list is long and patients still have to pay around 25% of thousands of dollars. Expanding medicaid will cost more but will improve the quality of life and health of many citizens. It needs to be a priority."

"Dear CMS,

I read the summary report of the Mediciaid waiver open forums held across the state of North Carolina in March and April. I feel the DHHS summary intentionally under reported overwhelming opposition to capitated managed care. I attended the session in Greenville North Carolina on April 14, 2016. In Greenville over 75 people stood up to speak about the plans for North Carolina's Medicaid waiver. We talked about decreased access. We talked about fractionated coverage. We talked about how the loss of our care coordination ability through Community Care of North Carolina will be as drastic setback to our care patients. No one in attendance stood up and supported the waiver in any fashion. My pediatric colleagues report similar experiences at all of the other sessions. My experiences there is no support for the Medicaid waiver by the people who actually give the care.

"Frankly as a Family Physician of 35 years experience I am appalled at NC's neglect of a vulnerable population who is uninsured and unable to be covered. I am fully in favor of expanding the Medicaid enrollment. I also favor lowering the age of Medicare to 50 or a single payer healthcare plan. For profit contracting for healthcare is a disaster waiting to happen. Someone will profit but the care will be lousy to ""save money"".
The ACA was a small step forward but much more is needed"
"I would strong encourage the provision of Medicaid Reform in NC. In my personal experience, I have a niece who is recently separated from her abusive husband. They have three children and she is trained as an LPN. She is not able to work F/T due to family and single parent responsibilities, and so does not have health insurance available to her. It saddens me to see how she receives no preventative care that I take for advantage as having with my BCBS plan, and she is forced to use the UNC (charity care) for urgent and medical care needs. Having even a basic preventative plan would go a long way, and I would recommend the state to consider this.

In addition, in my work as a visiting nurse, I see many low income elders cared for by low income family members in their homes. These family members work hard, but at low income positions that often do not offer insurance plans. Again, I see this group skipping all preventative care as they can not afford the extremely high cost of a basic MD visit. Offering a plan with expanded Medicaid would go far in achieving a Healthy Carolinians goal. I encourage the leaders to become more familiar with the populations who are truly working hard yet struggling without health insurance."
I am a physician in NC caring for Medicaid children. 50-60% depending on the month is how many children come to my office with Medicaid. I am concerned that the new plan will prevent me from seeing Medicaid patients because of the marginal reimbursement we see already. Any additional administrative work would require me to hire more staff or reduce my practice instead and stop seeing medicaid
I feel that people of low income and with out the ability to have health insurance need help. They should be bale to get Medicaid without a child or having to be on disability or SSI. Please think of those people and help them. They really need the help. I feel helping them is something our elected officials can do to help our state of NC.
"After witnessing patients and friends/family not able to receive healthcare services because they don't have health insurance it's extremely disheartening because everyone deserves the opportunity to receive healthcare services. Low-income, uninsured working adults in North Carolina should have the opportunity to qualify for insurance coverage as part of the Medicaid reform plan. Please consider this when deciding whether to approve the proposed changes that are leaving out a very large group that deserve the right to health insurance."

"1) Medicaid must provide a streamlined system for medical practices to use: Reduce bureaucratic hurdles. Our practice cannot deal with 15 different sets of billing and authorization rules.
2) Medicaid must provide for fair, timely payment to healthcare providers: We take caring for children seriously. But we are also a business and we need to be paid fairly and on time to make payroll, buy supplies, make rent-- all the things that it takes to run a business.
3) Medicaid needs CCNC: Community Care of NC is a nonprofit organization that helps Medicaid function better in NC. CCNC cares about working with medical practices to improve care. CCNC has been shown to save Medicaid money. The new Medicaid system must maintain CCNC to be successful."

"The NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration waiver request is deeply flawed for the following reasons:
1. Capitated care as a structure for restrictions on cost thereby restricting care
2. Corporate, for-profit management which increases administrative costs
3. Competitive networks with overlapping wasteful bureaucracies
4. Dismantles the Community Care of North Carolina's well-developed non-profit, award-winning, provider-led regional networks which had some of the lowest administrative costs and the lowest annual increase in costs in the US
5. Lack of provision for North Carolinians who do not qualify for insurance. Specifically, this program does not provide expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."

"I am a pediatrician in Moore County, NC. We take care of over 11,000 children with Medicaid. Our community-based care coordinator in our practice has been a valuable resource when trying to manage complicated or noncompliant patients or those with chaotic home lives. She helps make sure medicines are filled on time, fills pill boxes for families who get confused about medications, and does home visits- all of which help avoid expensive hospitalizations or disease flares. I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services. I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can successfully reinvent Community Care. If our practice has to deal with up to 15 different payers, this is going to result in significantly higher overhead in terms of administrative staff time. Our practice is currently using our resources to expand our integrated mental health services. This will suffer if there is increased burden and delay in getting Medicaid reimbursement. We currently do not restrict the number of medicaid patients our practice cares for but the proposed system will likely force us to decrease our medicaid percentage which will restrict care options for children in our area. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services"
"Hi
I am a general pediatrician for the last 14 years and worked in several settings both private practice and federally funded clinics
and had also experienced changes with medicaid transition to managed care.
I have seen big and small practices struggling to make payroll and patient care compromised duet to all the different ""rules"" every manage care agency had.
I have heard so many times ""I hate this new Medicaid, nothing is approved"" from the Doctors to practice managers to medical assistants dealing with this prior approval non-sense.
I will as practice owner consider not taking any new medicaid patients because I lived thru this so many times.

North Carolina has a very efficient system that saves money and improves outcomes.We are encouraging proper use of services like emergency room,We have an excellent team reaching out to patients and providers to make this work from generic prescriptions to coordination of care and early intervention.

"Thank you for this opportunity. I was one of more that 30 speakers that spoke in Asheville, North Carolina for a hearing on Medicaid reform. Almost without exception, speakers highlighted the importance of expanding Medicaid as a true way to provide health coverage for those that are in the coverage gap. I strongly encourage CMS to require expansion as a condition of any reform approval for the state. I've attached my testimony below."
Please see attached from the NC Pediatric Society
"North Carolina needs to expand Medicaid coverage to close the gap for people with extremely low incomes. Without this coverage, their health deteriorates to the point that they need more drastic and expensive medical treatment rather than receiving primary care. At this point, primary care for uninsured people in poverty is rare, provided by charities if at all. I am on the board of directors for one of these clinics where we have to fundraise to cover $200 cost per visit--but save hospital Emergency Departments $1500-$2000. The hospital then passes those costs for uninsured patients on as higher insurance rates. Our clinic also integrates medical and mental health care with community initiatives to promote wellness, like community gardens for better nutrition and healthy homes assessments for asthma triggers and prevention of falls. That is the kind of Medicaid Reform that NC needs! Please require the North Carolina legislature and governor to expand Medicaid before considering a waiver."
"I am a general Pediatrician in central NC and I do not support the destruction of NC Medicaid that approving this waiver would cause. I trained in Tennessee 15 years ago and was able to witness the dysfunction of Tenncare firsthand. I had a patient with Spina Bifida who needed routine urology followup. No pediatric Urologist in Memphis was signed up with his Tenncare MCO, so the ""solution"" was for the MCO to pay for ambulance transportation from Memphis to Nashville back and forth several times a year!
Bad for patients and more expensive for the tax payers.

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
[ADD PERSONAL STORY OR ANECDOTE]
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program continue to leave out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"
"As a Practice Manager for a pediatric practice in NC, I strongly oppose the proposed Medicaid Reform. This waiver is bad for children for the following reasons:
* It limits patient access. With the proposed changes, many peds practices will have to limit the number of Medicaid patients they see, making it harder for these patients to obtain care.
* This waiver is bad for cost containment. CCNC administrative costs are 50% lower than the average MCO administrative costs.
* The waiver also promises to increase bureaucratic red tape by increasing the number of claims submission locations and filing requirements from 1 to as many as 15."

The Medicaid waiver is bad for children of the state of North Carolina. Pediatric providers like me will struggle to provide care for medically complex patients in difficult social circumstances without the case management services of CCNC. One of the CCNC case managers worked tirelessly to help my patient with bulimia and no transportation connect to essential psychological services in her area. This care is as important as any medical assistance I can provide.

"""I am a health care professional in NC. I support our Community Care of NC Medicaid program. I am opposed to the 1115 Waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can reinvent Community Care. We have many school-based health centers in North Carolina who provided needed health care services to children. Many of the children seen in the school-based centers come from low income and economically depressed counties who would not have received the needed services if school-based health centers did not exist. Issues such as transportation, parents unable to leave their jobs to take their children to the PCP, lack of healthcare coverage and/or monetary funds are some reasons why children lack the services they need. The school-based centers are located where children spend the greater part of the day…at school. With parental consent the majority of their comprehensive health care needs are met in the school-based centers. Most of our centers are not the medical home for children we provide services. We work in coordination and approval from their PCP's to provide these services. Under Community Care, we deal with one payer who recognizes the services provided in the school-based centers and allows those credentialed centers to seek reimbursement from Medicaid. It is my understanding that the 1115 Wavier only allows reimbursement for the ""medical home"" which will exclude the school-based health centers from applying for reimbursement for the recognized services they provided. Without Medicaid reimbursement many of our centers would have to close their doors. Please review and turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services because our children need access to the comprehensive health care provided in the school-based health centers. Thank you for your consideration of this important issue."
"NC Medicaid reform will increase costs and bureaucratic red tape, making it more difficult to focus on trying to keep the children of NC healthy. I fear that the only people who will benefit will be administrators of MCO's. The administrative costs of CCNC are low, whereas private insurance companies have much higher costs. The difference should not be made up by taking away from the needs of our most vulnerable children."
"The extra hassle that is to come from this reform will decrease our willingness to take Medicaid and force our patients to seek care elsewhere. If we have to deal with multiple Medicaid vendors all with different rules we will not be able to afford the staff to handle all of those vendors. Even if we are able to pick just one of the 5 MCO's available to our patients, what do we do when we find out the MCO we chose because it pays us better than the other ones is NOT the MCO the specialists chose because it pays them terrible? There is not a positive outcome to this any way you look at it. An trust me, we've looked at it every way possible!

How does the state expect us to pay for the additional staff we will need to manage this administrative nightmare but still pay us the same as before (which are rates frozen since 2004)..."
"I am a practice administrator for a pediatric practice in Raleigh. We struggle with administering Medicaid to our patients now. I fear what headaches we will face if we have multiple payors involved. At this time we hand-hold patients through the process of changing physicians, seeking retroactive coverage and other issues that they do not know how to navigate so that we can eventually be paid for services already rendered. Our physicians are committed to quality care for every child but as the barriers and costs rise to being paid for quality care we must evaluate the return. We urge you to reconsider implementing Medicaid reform for our pediatric population."
"I am a pediatric practice administrator in Eastern NC and do not support the waiver. Keeping track of multiple payors will be and administrative struggle in the already complex world of keeping our offices a float. We have a mental health component to our primary care practice and when Medicaid mental health for children was farmed out to different LME'S, this was a nightmare. Too many new requirements and the decrease in reimbursement sent most Medicaid providers, who saw children with mental health issues in our area, running. Almost all of them quit seeing Medicaid kids for mental health. This continues to be an ongoing struggle. The way the system works now, works. If the same thing happens with the overall Medicaid plan, Medicaid providers will reconsider whether the struggle will be worth it."

"In addition to so many of our citizens being left out of important health care coverage, North Carolina is missing out on economic opportunity related to reforming Medicaid.

"Many of our school-based health centers in North Carolina are not the medical home for the students that they serve. Without continued Medicaid reimbursement for the services provided in our school-based health centers, many of our centers would not be able to continue to operate and to provide the services needed to our NC children and adolescents. Despite having medical homes on record, many youth do not access care through their medical home and only receive the services rendered by the school-based health centers. This fact is true for urban, semi-urban, and rural counties. Many barriers (including family issues, transportation issues, and other social determinants of health) impede receiving care through the medical home. School-based health centers provide a comfortable and convenient location in which students can receive services, and school-based health centers routinely communicate with the medical home to ensure coordination of care for patients. School-based health center services reduce health disparities and increase access to much needed care for our NC children and adolescents."
"As the parent of a disabled adult that receives Medicaid I do not support the Medicaid reforms as proposed by NC.
NC Medicaid already does not provide access to adequate services for example; physical therapy and glasses. These services were covered in the past. Thus state recipients are already seeing reduced services and further capitation will only reduce covered services to recipients.
By privatizing medicaid administration to for profit entities, a greater portion of funds will now go for administrative costs and will further reduce services for recipients.
There are already many service areas within the state that provide good access to services for recipients. No new service systems need to be created, especially those that are for-profit entities.
Instead of revising Medicaid as proposed, the state should be expanding Medicaid coverage to low income individuals who are ineligible for ACA access, and sufficient money should be allocated to the Medicaid system for recipients to receive adequate health care services."

"As a family doctor at a community health center, I feel strongly that the legislature does not need to ""reform"" Medicaid. Bringing in private entities is likely to increase, not decrease, costs.
The one thing that the North Carolina legislature and Gov. McCrory could do to improve Medicaid is to approve Medicaid expansion. It would help patients, doctors, and communities. It is unconscionable that our tax dollars go to other states to pay for Medicaid expansion but don't stay here in North Carolina. Remember who said, ""Even as you do unto the least of these, so you do unto me""?"
"To whom it may concern,
I am a second year medical student in NC, and I would like to go into primary care, specifically family medicine. My passion is for underserved, rural areas such as the mountains of western NC or southeastern NC. I have spent time with family physicians in these rural settings and have recognized the enormous gap in health care coverage, especially for the working poor who do not qualify for Medicaid but would have qualified had the Medicaid expansion been implemented in NC. My heart breaks as I watch these family docs who desire nothing more than to help care for their patients but feel helpless when they are blocked by the obstacles of our broken healthcare system. There is nothing more frustrating then to feel like you have the skills and training to help someone, but are deterred because of the system. Consider how the denial of Medicaid expansion in NC will affect the retention rate of medical students in NC. I will be choosing my residency program in a few short years, and this issue is the main reason why I would look outside of NC. I assure you that I am not the only future primary care doctor who plans to leave NC if the current conditions are not changed."
"I am a current medical student at UNC School of Medicine hoping to one day have a rural family medicine or obstetrics practice. I have seen firsthand the negative impact that not expanding Medicaid has had on so many people here in North Carolina. A crucial part of Medicaid reform here is expansion. The painful truth is that not expanding Medicaid has hurt our citizens, their health, and also threatens my future practice. I hope to be able to practice here in NC, where I have called home for over 25 years, but if Medicaid expansion is not part of the reform then I may have to go elsewhere.

"I am a pediatrician in NC and I do not support this waiver. Pediatricians stop me at national meetings to ask if the stories about integrated case managers in our practices and the help we get from CCNC are true. This is a widely admired program everywhere except the General Assembly in Raleigh. I do not understand why they can't appreciate the benefits we have here. Multiple studies have shown the vast sums of money CCNC has saved, including the last study that the General Assembly hired!

Please save us from the mistake our General Assembly wants to make by making care for our poorest citizens way more expensive - defend the taxpayers, CMS say NO!

This is medicaid regression, not reform!"

"I am a Pediatrician in Raleigh, and I do not support this waiver."
Require Medicaid expansion.
"As a pediatrician, I have grave concerns about the proposed changes to the NC Medicaid system. Particularly, CCNC has been an important part of patient care and offers the best support for patient care. The change to multiple MCOs make the system more complicated and potentially lowers already marginal reimbursement for providers taking care of our pediatric patients, the majority of Medicaid recipients. The cost trend per Medicaid patient in NC has steadily decreased under the current construct and it is highly likely to increase in the proposed changes. Furthermore, the majority of pediatric providers in NC currently accept patients with Medicaid and the number of providers willing to take Medicaid patients would likely dwindle under the proposed changes, thereby limiting access to primary care providers. The consequence of which is more unnecessary visits to the ER for non-emergent matters ultimately driving up costs. I strongly urge the legislature to reconsider its proposed changes."
"I am a Pediatrician in NC. I think the NC legislature is being foolish to allow private insurance companies to manage the Medicaid contract. In other states they have had to create multiple agencies to oversee the MCOs (look at Tennessee)
https://tn.gov/commerce/section/tenncare-oversight

It deeply upsets me as a Republican to see my Republican General Assembly make decisions that will expand the NC government and waste tax dollars on administrative cost that could go for medical care or lowering taxes."
"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina, and I -DO NOT- support the medicaid waiver from North Carolina. 90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall."
"There is grave concerns that with so many options for patients (up to 15) that those options that primary care pediatricians will accept may be different than what specialists will use, which will make referrals to needed specialists difficult to impossible.

Additionally, this is not the right kind of waiver for what is requested; specifically for innovation for improved quality of care and access, which is already well above standard in the US, and this current waiver would NOT reach these goals.

North Carolina's current Community Cares of North Carolina (a non-profit organization aimed at improving quality, reducing cost, and promoting access) is recognized -nationally- as an outstanding program. The current waiver calls for it to be dissolved."
"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina, and I am gravely concerned about the medicaid waiver application.

I do not support this waiver and recommended changes….

Expansion of medicaid in NC, accepting more federal dollars to support the system, would IMPROVE access and care in NC FAR more than current recommendations in the waiver. NC has not chosen to do that thus far.

CCNC has been a well established program, that has over the past few years saved money and improved access to care for children in NC… Elimination of this program will reverse this trend"
"In typical political fashion, this legislation is attempting to fix something that is not only ""NOT BROKEN"", but is working and working well and this legislation will hurt not help. I am a private practice pediatrician and this will be detrimental to my patients and many patients in our practice. This is the wrong way to go."
"I am a Pediatrician in NC and NC DHHS and CMS need to understand that the Pediatricians are in Open Revolt over this ridiculous plan to destroy all that we have built with CCNC. I have not met ONE Pediatrician who supports this- and our cooperation is the only way any improvement in healthcare is possible. Doctors are pretty smart about healthcare- I wish the legislators in NC had listened to us the multiple times we talked, emailed, and visited with them expressing our opposition to having 15 places to send the bill instead of one.

The bill signed by the governor states CCNC's contract with the state ends as so as capitated MCO ""care"" begins. That is what the ratified bill actually says. You might notice that they don't emphasize that in the waiver.

"Commenters have expressed concern about many key areas of the proposed model, to which DHHS deferred definitive declaration of intent. Rather, DHHS stated that the issue raised will be addressed ""during program development."" While it appears that some stakeholders will be given the opportunity to contribute ideas after a demonstration is approved, it's not clear how they will be selected, in what role(s) they will serve, or whether any stakeholder will have additional opportunity for additional public comment on any program design issue.

Public comment by any interested party is an important part of an environmental scan. It also demands a formal, timely, and public response. There is nothing in this waiver that promises that future public comment will be opened on all aspects of future program design, and if the demonstration is approved, CMS is certainly under no obligation to provide oversight of the public comment/response cycle.

DHHS concedes that ""many of the comments were related to implementation issues and will be addressed during program development."" Questions about payment structure, number of networks, auto-enrollment and open enrollment period, etc. -- so-called ""implementation issues"" -- are not micro-issues; they're key to the success or failure of any healthcare delivery system. Mechanisms for oversight of MCOs are certainly not peripheral here. It is reasonable for NC healthcare providers to expect answers, or at least declarations of general intent, before agreeing to support such a radical overhaul of health care financing in their state. Although DHHS has stated repeatedly it wants to engage stakeholders, it has opted to defer speaking to these devil-filled details until after CMS approves the waiver.

In my state's managed Medicaid program, I have seen countless examples of rules being approved too generally and leaving ""the details"" ""till later"" with frustrating, non-transparent, contradictory results.

CMS should require that comments that multiple stakeholders asked about key issues should be addressed at an appropriate level of detail -- before this demonstration application is considered complete.

"Dear CMS:
I am writing to share my significant concerns with the Medicaid change that has been proposed for North Carolina. I do not believe the term ""reform"" is appropriate because I dispute the notion that we have anything other than an exemplary program for children in NC. I am mystified by the assertion that NC Medicaid is broken- slide 13 of DMA presentation to the JLOC on 2/9/16 shows the PMPM cost continuing to drop. It makes no sense to abandon this winning program.

I am a general Pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in Southern Pines, Seven Lakes and Raeford NC and am one of the managing partners. I am also the elected Chair of the Section on Administration on Practice Management (SOAPM) of the American Academy of Pediatrics. I am also on the Board of the NC Pediatric Society, but it is important to note that in this letter I am speaking on behalf of myself and my practice only.

It is critical for all children in NC that we ""get this right""- Children account for a over 70% of patients in Medicaid but a minority of Medicaid costs. Most pediatric practices have 20-80% medicaid. A few weeks of non payment on that significant a percentage of patients will bankrupt pediatric practices quickly, leaving even privately insured children without pediatric care.

I completed my Pediatric residency in Memphis,Tennessee and was able to see the dysfunction of Tenncare up close. The Children's Hospital was part of all the Tenncare plans, but I struggled on a regular basis to find in-network specialists for my clinic patients.

I fully understand that DMA has to comply with the law that was passed and I very much appreciate the hard work of the excellent employees at DMA whom I very much respect.

DMA and CMS are being asked to ""square a circle"" to decrease provider hassle and complexity by creating a system with potentially 15 different Medicaid payors. Patients are mobile- we often see children who move from one part of the state to the other in informal guardianship, sometimes with an aunt or grandparent. We will end up dealing with all 15 payors no matter what the wishful thinking is, unless we refuse to see new patients who have a medicaid MCO we aren't signed up with and dump them on the ER (which dramatically increases cost). Currently our practice sees new medicaid patients all the time, even in difficult family situations.

Please do NOT approve this waiver! Children need to be left out of this mess!

"I am a pediatrician in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. Our medicaid population is between 10-15%, and reflect our highest need patients, and some of our most endearing. Having lived and practiced in four other states, I can tell you North Carolina has a top medicaid program with the development of Community Care NC. It is revolutionary, and extremely effective for all involved, the patients and providers. I ask you please do not tinker with this program and interupt such a successful venture. The proposed reforms will undermine the program, undermine the thoroughness of patient care and set this state backwards, not forward. Patients and providers alike will suffer, which will ultimately lead to more burdens on the state down the road. Proposing these cuts may seem like prudent short term budget improvements, but it will undoubtedly just kick the can down the road regarding costs and demands on the state overall, and individuals in the interim.

Please reconsider this reform motion.

"I am Pediatrician in Central NC and I do NOT support this waiver. Access to care is going to crater in when doctors go from dealing with one payor (DMA) that currently pays within 14 days to 15 different payors who have an incentive not to pay.

If I could make one wish about Medicaid reform, it would be for children 0-21 yo to remain under the existing ""straight"" medicaid system with continued CCNC support. Children are most of the volume but least of the cost- why entangle children in what is really an attempt to fix problems in adult medicine?

Healthy parents are more likely to have healthy children. NC should expand medicaid instead of sending our tax dollars to the other states that have expanded medicaid.

The Federal Government needs to find a way to stop this travesty, even if the legislators in NC were hoodwinked by the MCO lobbyists."
I am an academic general pediatrician with a long history (30+ years) of working with the Medicaid population in primary care settings and hospitals. The reforms proposed are a huge step back for North Carolina. They would drain 6% more in administrative costs from patient care and add enormous complexity and overhead to our already-beleaguered physicians. I fear they would also drive many community physicians away from caring for Medicaid patients and result in diminished access to care. I oppose these reforms. They are bad for NC pediatricians and for NC's children and youth.
"I have been a pediatrician in NC for over 20 years. Our practice continues to see thousands of children under medicaid, although the cuts in reimbursement have pushed us to a critical point. The waver being discuss will greatly harm what is left of a once great program. CCNC has SAVED money and the statistical distortions being used to undernine its record of success are outrageous."

"As a taxpayer, I'm concerned that the proposed changes to Medicaid will not help cost containment. Currently, CCNC administrative costs are about 6% compared with 12% for private insurers. Therefore, MCOs will likely operate at a loss for the first couple years and the number of MCOs who remain will decrease, thereby decreasing competition and driving up costs as the MCOs are for-profit agencies. As seen in Connecticut, the decision to revert back to a unified Medicaid program saved money as cost per patient decreased."
I fully support the move toward North Carolina's acceptance of federal Medicaid funds immediately. It is shocking that the state has held up legislation to make these funds available to its citizens in need of them.
I am a pediatrician in Rural Eastern North Carolina. The waiver proposal will make access to medical care difficult for families with children. It will also make providing care difficult for pediatricians across the state who have dedicated their lives to caring for these children. The proposed model does not take child health into account and should not be implemented in our state.
"Dear CMS,
I noted that the first comment to the North Carolina Medicaid waiver was a plea from an administrator at a Federally Qualified Health Center to develop special provisions for their expected increase in patients. As a pediatrician practicing in Eastern North Carolina in a clinic that serves 7300 children on Medicaid foresee a shift away from their current pediatric medical home into FQHCs as the increased administrative burden and the expected decrease in reimbursements force practices such as my own to limit caring for children with Medicaid. A FQHC's costs per patient are 30% greater than current Medicaid payments to my ""private"" clinic. I am proud of the high quality, financially efficient care I provide all the families under my care. Any primary care savings through the North Carolina Medicaid waiver will be partially offset by the CMS direct subsidy to FQHCs. The cost shifting to CMS from the state Medicaid budget by the projected greater use of federally qualified health clinics needs to be included when making decisions about the section 1115 waiver.

"To Whom It May Concern:

I did all of my medical/surgical training in California, between 1986 and 1995. I then practiced pediatric surgery in California full-time, from 1995 through 1999. Roughly 40% of my patients were receiving California Medicaid.

California underwent a change in Medicaid similar to what has been proposed in North Carolina, with a type of ""privatization"" of the plan. At that time, this was referred to as ""Medicaid Managed Care."" Multiple reports and studies have documented the disruption of pediatric specialty care that resulted--unfortunately, the private companies that agreed to collaborate with the State of California to administer the plan found that they needed ""administrative costs"" for such services. As a result, physician reimbursement for medical/surgical services (provided to California Medicaid patients) decreased by about 20%. In addition, multiple different plans made the hassle/paperwork factor so burdensome (and expensive) to many pediatric specialists that they were forced to stop providing care to these patients--unfortunately, pediatric specialist office overhead expenses was too high.

Since so few specialists could afford to provide care to these children, my personal experience was that these kids tended to be denied care until their conditions/diseases became advanced/severe. Families with kids in need found it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to provide specialty providers who would take California Medicaid.

In my opinion, this California Medicaid ""experiment"" was a huge failure (and is one of the reasons I ultimately left California and moved to North Carolina). I am very concerned that our North Carolina legislators may repeat the mistakes of the California system. I have yet to see clear-cut specific clear rules/regulations/guidelines in the proposed North Carolina system that will prevent us from having a California-type mess.

Thanks for reading this. (These comments represent my personal opinions and may not reflect those of my employer.)

"I am a pediatrician in the Triangle area. CCNC has made an enormous positive impact on several of my pediatric patients. Most recently, I have an ex-25week premature infant born to a 15yr old high school freshman. The baby stayed in the hospital for 3.5 months post birth before discharge home. His CCNC worker visits him at home, helps coordinate the many subspecialty follow up and therapy appointments, advocates for the mother's continued schooling, and regularly communicates to best collaborate with me for the complex care of this young patient and his family. Without CCNC, I have no doubt that this baby would have been hospitalized multiple times, his mother would not be continuing her high school degree, and his development would not be normal (with premature age adjustment). CCNC is invaluable to the patients and families of North Carolina!"
"CMS - NC Pediatricians need your help to save The Best Medicaid Program in the country! I have been a pediatrician in eastern NC for 31 years. I have watched incremental improvement in NC Medicaid since the late 80's and have been proud to say I do not know a pediatrician in the state who does NOT take Medicaid! After reading the State's Waiver proposal, I am very afraid of what will happen to our great program. It can't improve state access or $$ savings without substantial buy-in from physicians. We are 8% less than 5 years ago on a PMPM basis - a drop built entirely on CCNC's positive relationship with NC physicians. It certainly cannot improve access for children since over 90% of Pediatricians now take Medicaid, and that number will be cut more than half with the ill will generated by this regressive waiver proposal. This waiver is really about the survival of Pediatrics in North Carolina. Please see my attached PDF in support of denying this waiver - or at least excluding children from this disaster. Can you please help NC maintain its award-winning ""best of breed"" Medicaid program? Reject this waiver out-right, or exclude children under 18. Any other outcome will be disastrous for the healthcare of ALL children in the state - not just Medicaid! Graham Barden MD Coastal Children's Clinic New Bern, NC Craven County 28562"
"North Carolina has a high child mortality rate and that could be lowered by offering Medicaid to all low income individuals.
It is criminal to withhold medicaid from people causing them to have no health insurance. I can't believe that legislatures, who get free health insurance from the citizens of North Carolina, don't offer the same to people who can't afford health insurance.
Our federal medicaid dollars are going to other states because we are not taking advantage of them by offering medicaid to our under-employed residents.."
"I think it is ridiculous that I am paying taxes for Medicare that people in my state don't derive any benefit on simply because Gov McCrory and the legislature now in power (and I'd like you to take note that it is only""now in power, refuse to do the reasonable thing and get help from the federal government' program. Other Republican-run states have used the federal program and are pleased with the results. But our state powers that be, insist that they are overhauling the system. That is code for not helping many people who truly need the help. This also works against those who use our hospitals and Dr's as when these poor people need help as a result of never seeing a Dr when they needed to, they now enter the system (what there is of it) as a catastrophe and bring the cost of medical care up in our state for the rest of us. I say vote these fools out. So far, I have seen many programs that benefit the wealthy(who pay for much of what those in power do to get reelection) but little for those of us who can't do anything for them personally. I am an Independent and I know what I'm going to do when I vote this time and I have never missed an election."
"This piece of legislation is terrible for children, their caregivers, NC taxpayers, and small medical practices. It is good for red tape, unnecessary complexity, and large insurance company administrators. We deserve better value than this. If this is implemented, many small practices who serve large Medicaid practices in rural areas will have to close their doors forever, limiting access for children in areas that are already underserved."
"My husband lost lost his job in 2011 as the result of a government contract restructure. The three highest paid engineers, all over 55, were let go. He has been unable to land a permanent full time position since then. This means that we are required to pay for our own health insurance.

Even with a government supplement through ""Obamacare"", we are going bankrupt! Being unemployed, we would have qualified for medicaid in every state where Medicaid was expanded, but not in NC. We are almost at the end of our rope!

I am a cancer survivor and have been unable to go for my annual cancer screening - blood tests, and occasional scan - because we simply cannot afford the extra payments out of pocket. Even if my cancer reappeared, I could not afford treatment.

Our youngest daughter is disabled but does not qualify for medicaid. We provide her care and are quickly getting to the point where I have no idea how we will pay for her medication much less doctors' visits.

Our story is sad but not unique. Too many families once in the middle class are slipping further and further behind in spite of our best efforts to stay abreast. Not having to pay thousands of dollars in health care every year would be a huge help to those of us caught in the health care hole and unable to crawl out.

HELP!!! My family and so many, many more need your help!
Thank you."
"My name is Mike Villareal, MD and I do not support this waiver and recommended changes.

Expansion of medicaid in NC, accepting more federal dollars to support the system, would IMPROVE access and care in NC FAR more than current recommendations in the waiver. NC has not chosen to do that thus far.

CCNC has been a well established program, that has over the past few years saved money and improved access to care for children in NC… Elimination of this program will reverse this trend

This is going to be a disaster for access for patients in North Carolina in both rural and urban populations.

90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall. CCNC in NC has improved tremendously care being delivered in the medical home, not in Emergency or urgent care environments, saving the system money.

Current budget for medicaid has 6% for administration. Waiver includes 12%, as ""for profit"" companies will need to have an operating margin. This extra 6% will likely lead to reductions in reimbursement for physicians, which will lead them to discontinue taking medicaid patients.

There is great concerns that with so many options for patients (up to 15) that those options that primary care pediatricians will accept may be different than what specialists will use, which will make referrals to needed specialists difficult to impossible.

this is not the right kind of waiver, bent on specifics for innovation for improved quality of care and access, which is already well above standard in the US, and this current waiver would NOT reach these goals.

Going from one unified medicaid systems to 12-15 different MCOs. There is no need to have that many in a state our size, with population or geographic size. Tennessee, which is similar geographically and in population, had 4.

Transparency of current medicaid system, for communication and expectations, is BETTER than private insurance. Increased number of medicaid MCOs, with different rules, different formularies, and with an eye towards their own profit, will increase physician and office time in determining approved medications, and getting authorization for needed services."
"Medicaid expansion should not be seen as a burden on taxpayers, but rather as key to enhancing the economic well-being of the citizens whether or not they are direct beneficiaries of this policy. It ultimately benefits everyone and everyone's health to have affordable access to healthcare. Having Medicaid expansion provides a more positive economic climate for the State, making it more attractive to employers to establish and expand business in the State. When there are sound policies and programs that promote basic needs of the citizenry such as in the fields of health and education, there is a strong foundation for economic growth. Young families are attracted to areas perceived as providing services that ensure and enhance quality of life. It goes hand in hand with a solid economy and good job opportunities."
"As a pediatric specialist, I am disappointed a few politicians in North Carolina want to dismantle a working low cost, efficient Medicaid model ( 6% overhead) , and replace it with a high cost , inefficient multiple-plan model ( 12-14 % overhead). If implemented as the waiver is submitted, I expect the added financial cost of my office labor to deal with multiple gatekeepers, and the personal energy sink I will encounter will be overbearing, and I will retire early. I am only 55, and have an 25 year expertise and judgement that will be wasted, and the children of North Carolina will be the big losers."
"I have been a physician in North Carolina providing gastrointestinal disease services to both children and adults since 1978. I strongly oppose the new Medicaid reform proposals outlined above. I urge you to continue CCNC Medicaid program presently providing access for our most vulnerable patients, our children, while minimizing cost per patient by allowing patients access to lower cost office care rather than ER visits , while decreasing administrative costs to approximately 6 percent. For profit involvement will increase administrative costs and the need for return on investment for stockholders. More importantly I believe it will drive pediatricians who see as many as 30 to 70 percent of their patients as Medicaid receipients, especially in rural NC to close or severely limit access to the detriment of our children, driving up ER visits and costs to the system unnecessarily.
This bill is a bad idea, will decrease access and increase costs and will add unnecessary administrative paperwork and inefficiency as well.

"I am a Pediatric NP practicing in the Sandhills. I strongly encourage you to turn down 1115 waiver, which would turn CCNC into a ""for profit"" organization, managed by 15 different MCO's. It will create chaos and delay funding of services that are critical for the delivery of healthcare to children of North Carolina! This waiver would affect over 71% of the pediatric population in NC. As a pediatric provider, I witness the successes of CCNC and integrated behavioral health on a daily basis. CC4C does an amazing job coordinating care for our state's most vulnerable population. If this waiver is passed, it will inevitably lead to decreased quality of care for the children of NC. Please don't sacrifice the children of North Carolina. Say NO to the 1115 waiver!"
"I am a primary care physician practicing fulltime in a charity-run, safety-net facility that serves only the uninsured (ie none have Medicaid). Every day, I witness the major deficit (even danger) with the current Medicaid: its failure to enroll non-disabled adults even with critically low income.

North Carolina Medicaid is already delivering quality services in a single-payer, state-run program that includes ambitious monitoring and assessment of outcomes through a provider-developed network, Community Care of North Carolina.

The NC Legislature and Administration's cost motives (of controlling expenditures through competing networks delivering systematic and coordinated services) has actually already been achieved, with one of the lowest per-patient cost-expanding Medicaid in the country.

The most serious deficiency in current Medicaid is the failure to enroll 300,00-500,000 of the state's low-income, non-disabled non-Seniors, many of whom have serious ongoing health needs, out of reach to their current wages. Any modification of the state's Medicaid needs to include an Expansion of those eligible to enroll for coverage.

Choosing to privatize and capitate service-delivery is entirely ideological, counting on a system which will include MORE overhead (including marketing and profits). If this waiver is to be accepted, there needs to be a simultaneous agreement to expand enrollment to those current unable to participate in ANY of the ACA's programs.

" -- I am a parent who cares about the health of the children of NC.
-- I oppose the NC Medicaid waiver.
-- It would limit access to quality doctors and services for children.
-- It would create much more bureaucracy in NC healthcare.
-- It would do away with Community Care of NC (CCNC), which is dedicated to working with doctors and families and has a strong record of saving the state money."
"As a pediatrician in Wayne County, NC, I am deeply concerned about the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal. This complicated system to ensure competition will increase administrative barriers to participation and likely reduce access to care among both primary care providers and specialists. Any reductions in services or access particularly will affect children who are 71% of the estimated population affected by the proposed waiver. I would encourage the powers that be to not mess up an already good thing with the existing CCNC model, which has already shown cost effectiveness and continued access to quality medical care for our state's most vulnerable populations."
My comment file is attached. Thank you for providing transparency and an opportunity for public comment.
"I am a practicing pediatrician in NC for the past 19 years. CCNC has created a statewide medical home model for pediatrics that has resulted in tremendous cost savings with reduction in PMPM costs and improved patient outcomes. The delivery of care for Medicaid beneficiaries in NC by CCNC has earned national accolades and has been a model for other states. To dismantle what has been achieved and create a new delivery system will disrupt gains and likely increase overall costs. The major impact will be felt by community pediatricians who will not be able to sustain the additional decrease in physician payments in the guise of a capitated system. It will be extremely difficult to earn any potential bonus payments and we are likely to see many pediatricians leave creating a vacuum in many parts of the state in particular the more rural communities. This is also at a time when physician stress and burnout is at an all time high. Privatizing and allowing commercial entities to compete will further hurt and stress the pediatric providers resulting in attrition and ultimately a decrease in access, quality and outcomes. The management costs for the Medicaid program (PMPM) has consistently been one of the lowest in the nation in the current system. I as a representative of over 10 pediatric providers in Onslow County would like to voice a strong objection to the Reform proposal submitted. It is a horrible idea.

"I hate waste. And that's what I see as a doctor, when diabetics and heart patients come to me too late to prevent disability.

There are 500,000 people in NC who don't qualify for NC Medicaid but don't earn enough to get a subsidy on the ACA Marketplace. They all may be ""wasted"" if they can't get the preventive care they need. These are the people that ""Medicaid Expansion"" was designed to help, and yet our state government refuses to provide the assistance that the Federal Government if offering.

We MUST expand Medicaid in North Carolina."
"I am a pediatrician in Moore County. I love our Community Care of NC Medicaid program. We take care of over 11,000 children on Medicaid and CHIP. We really like having the community-based care coordinators in our practice. I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services. I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can reinvent Community Care, especially if our practice has to deal with up to 15 different payers. Under Community Care, we deal with one payer and one community-based care coordination system. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services."
"It is extremely important to expand Medicaid in our state to those made most vulnerable by poverty and inadequate access to the opportunities they need to get ahead (ex. quality public education, fair hiring practices, lack of assets and familial wealth.) Note that we can and should close the coverage gap in NC. Not only is the the morale thing to do, it makes complete economic sense. It is unacceptable that any Medicaid reform plan in our state would not address the need to close the coverage gap. Healthy people have better mental health, better birth outcomes, better chances at a long and productive life. This is a statement backed up by evidence which we simply cannot ignore. As someone with strong understanding of public health research and extensive work experience collaborating with historically disenfranchised communities to increase access to healthcare, I ask that you please take these comments seriously and make a good-faith effort to close the coverage gap in our state. As a former case manager with Duke Hospital in Durham, NC I remember one case in particular that highlights the way in which healthcare can save lives. Darnell (name changed) came to our program stating he had been feeling very sick and rapidly losing weight. He went to several emergency rooms throughout the state only to be turned away with minimal screening and told to establish with a PCP. Too poor to find the money to obtain a primary care appointment at the local FQHC, Darnell, a single male who did not quality for Medicaid in North Carolina, finally was admitted to the hospital several months later with late-stage colon cancer. He was dying when I left that job and I could not help but think about the way in which our failure to close the coverage gap and offer him access to basic primary care services could have perhaps saved his life or at least delayed the rapidity with which his cancer ravaged his body. These are the stories that data and number fail to tell the American public, for if more people new what closing the coverage gap actually meant for their community, more people would be speaking up. Please take action on this matter. It is our moral obligation. Thank you."

"Women in many counties in North Carolina were shown by the National Cancer Institute to have I-131, a radioactive carcinogen in their breast milk during nuclear testing in the late 1950's. They may be more vulnerable to develop breast cancer when further exposed to the cancer-causing chemicals in coal ash being released by Duke Energy into major rivers that provide our water supplies. When these women develop breast cancer, if they are poor, they may not be able to afford optimal medical care for their goverment/private sector induced disease. N.C. needs Medicade expansion to assure that these women are not unjustly denied optimal medical care.

"I am the mother of a 42 year old adult with Autism. When my son was 21 he became an award of the state of North Carolina and I became his legal guardian. He lives in an ICFMR facility that relies upon Medicaid funding for his total care; his portion of Social Security Disability is not any place near sufficient to cover his total medical and problematic needs as well as medical and psycho-social needs. I am a taxpayer and have been my entire life. Medicaid is not a program just for poor people but it supports the elderly, people with disabilities, and over a half million people who fall within the poverty line. North Carolina made it a law that my son would become their responsibility and as a parent, I am expecting my state to match it's commitment to people with disabilities and all those who qualify for Medicaid services. The tax forgiveness from the Federal Government makes it pliable for North Carolina to treat its citizens with the same consideration it allows tax advantages for industries to locate to our state's business/economic infrastructure with tax free amenities. The difference is that private companies are not obligated to remain in our state even when given the tax advantages. People born with physical disabilities, poor, and those who live to be elderly--a large portion of our state's population should not have to suffer when it comes to medical and supportive services they are entitled to because our state see's these individuals' critical needs as a tax burden rather than a tax responsibility. I am encouraging North Carolina policymakers to legislate quality of life for people like my son and countless others who did not opt to be born with physical disabilities or mental handicaps just as no one elects to be born into poverty as a pre-requisite to being born or becoming a citizen of the Old North State where the Living is anything but great for well over 500,000 citizens, many of who have Autism just as my son does and relies heavily upon Medicaid funding for his basic survival needs and medical needs. Thank you."
"To whom it may concern:
I am a 53 year-old general pediatrician, and have been in private practice in Asheville, NC for 25 years. I would like to state that there is NO REASON TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT PLAN FOR MEDICAID REFORM. I have several serious concerns:
1) The current program run by CCNC has been working well. We have had the smallest growth in medicaid costs in our entire country.
2) The privatization of NC medicaid administration WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE! CCNC has functioned with an overhead cost of 6%. Private insurers would be permitted to pay up to 12% for overhead. Also, these are for-profit companies that by definition will be expected by their stakeholders to profit from this venture.
3) Privatizing Medicaid WILL BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE! Both medicaid and our private payers have been a nightmare to collect from. Witness the experience with NC Tracks, and also remember that our state insurance commissioner has had to be involved this year because Blue Cross has not been paying providers for services rendered. We are STILL awaiting BCBS payments from months ago. Imagine if we now have to contend with 5 additional insurers in order to collect for our medicaid patients? Also, our medicaid patients already often have the wrong primary providers listed on their cards. What if we are forced to repeatedly bill the same encounter because we are told that a patient has been assigned to the wrong insurer??? This is incredibly costly for us!
4) Assuming that the cost of administration increases with the use of private insurers, who will bear the cost of the increases? Assuming that our legislature won't allocate any additional funding, and that patients won't be dropped from the medicaid rolls, then the only answer is that providers will face yet ANOTHER fee cut. We already receive less for our medicaid patients than we did in 2004, have the highest percentage of medication patients, and earn less than any other medical specialty. To cut our pay even further would be intolerable. I'm sure no legislature or legislative staffers would tolerate earning less than they did in the same job 12 years ago.
In summary, There is no good reason to make this change, unless current lawmakers are inappropriately influenced by insurance companies, or are ideologically determined to privatized state duties even if doing so makes absolutely no rational sense.
Thank you for your attention,
Susan R. Cohen, MD"
"The proposed changes to Medicaid in NC are frightening to me as the parent of a child on Medicaid. Privatization would likely result in the need to change my daughters healthcare providers (both her medical home and several specialists).
Additionally NC failed to include Medicaid expansion in their proposal. The Medicaid Gap is causing much hardship in my state."
"As a pediatrician in NC, I am deeply concerned about the model set for in the NC proposed 1115 Waiver. In fact, although 71% of those affected are estimated to be children, the vast majority of the pediatricians providing their care do not believe it will improve child health.

About 40% of children in NC are insured through Medicaid, and children are the majority of people in NC receiving health care through Medicaid. If Medicaid reform doesn't work for children, Medicaid reform won't work.

I will continue to work as hard as I can to assure that all children, and particularly low-income children, have access to quality health care. However, pediatricians across the state are already stretched thin with recent Medicaid payment reductions, moving to EMR, implementing meaningful use and other changes in this rapidly changing medical world. I am deeply concerned about our ability to continue to deliver effective medical care as supports like CCNC are removed, specialists are harder to access, and multiple administrative and payment barriers are erected. As it gets harder, more bureaucratic, and less rewarding to care for kids, practices will become more stretched and stressed and more pediatricians will likely retire or otherwise limit serving children. Medicaid Expansion would do so much more for children and families in NC than this proposed waiver, which instead will likely limit access and make it more difficult for pediatricians to care for children.

Children are NC's future. Pediatricians support children. Please stand up for children and incorporate pediatricians throughout this process."
"NC's failure to expand Medicaid was a terrible mistake and has resulted in so many NC citizens not having access to basic, quality healthcare. They aren't able to get needed medical care on a timely basis and only seek care when the illness gets to a crisis point. This is not good for them, and not good for NC's healthcare system. And at its most fundamental, this isn't how we should treat fellow human beings. Refusing to accept dollars that are available makes no sense, and it's time to right that wrong."
"Nearly a half million needy North Carolinians have been denied medical coverage by a Gov. and a state legislature who are playing politics with our tax payer money. Much of their posturing is in the interest of private business, not the lives and health of our citizens.

"I am a practicing primary care physician in the state of NC. The state government is making changes to a Medicaid system that wasn't broke in the first place. It is the crown jewel of Medicaid programs in the US and has saved the federal and state government millions of dollars in health care costs. The Medicaid system starting setting up Patient Centered Medical Homes in the 1990s before they were even called Patient Centered Medical Homes. Roughly 90% of the indigent populations in NC have primary care physicians. The cost over runs in the Medicaid program had nothing to do with the patient part of the program and the physicians who managed those patients yet the state legislature decided to create a hybrid system allowing the managed care industry to have access to the system. The more cynical of us felt this was payment for the millions of dollars the managed care industry contributed to Republican campaigns over the last 6 years. This application is a bad idea and I would predict many physicians will opt out of the program if it is enacted. Managed care companies typically squeeze out their ""pound of flesh"" by lowering physician fees to levels which no longer cover our over head costs. I would encourage you not to approve this legislation. Allen Dobson is the director of the CCNC and a personal friend. We have worked together for years to make this system what it is today. The IT system created for Medicaid is a model the rest of the nation could follow. I am a practicing physician who sees Medicaid patients everyday and the system works and it works well as it is now structured. We make improvements in it every year. I would suggest you think very seriously about the decision you are about to make. It could have devastating consequences for the indigent in the state of NC.

"CMS - Please deny this disaster of a waiver!
I am a pediatrician in NC and belong to a large practice with 1/3 Medicaid patients.
I went to one of the ""public comment sessions"" held by NC DMA at several locations around the state to satisfy CMS's requirement that they solicit comments. Many of the comments were from pediatricians and ALL were asking the state NOT to kill the Nation's Best Medicaid program. I've learned that the same comments were made at all sessions across the state..
Despite the 99% negative comments received, the waiver was not materially changed! That should tell CMS that the state is unwilling or not allowed by the legislature to design a program that is equal to what we have! We are certain our payments will go down below the current 76% of Medicare and managing 5 to 15 Medicaid Companies all with different rules will be an administrative nightmare!.
With our current CCNC program, we have a substantial ""buy-in"" from physicians - especially pediatricians. ""Buy-in"" is required for a cost-effective successful program. This proposed program will be neither.
We currently have a cost effective program with an 8% reduction in PMPM over the past 5 years! Once the state loses the trust of the physicians - and that can happen in a single year of a dysfunctional program - it will take years to regain what we have now!
I understand a state has the right to totally implode their indigent healthcare system - but this time they need CMS's PERMISSION to do so! Just say ""NO!"" to this terrible ""solution"" to a non-existent problem! Or at least exclude the pediatric population from this disaster in the making! Pediatrics is NOT broken!

"I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, and Clinical Specialist in Child and Adolescent Psych-MH Nursing. I have been providing psychotherapy and medication management services to children and their families since 1990. I have had the good fortune to work for a large pediatric primary care practice for the last 2 years providing Integrated Mental Health Services to the patients and families referred to me by our Pediatricians and Pediatric Nurse Practitioners. This is a very efficient and effective model for the patients and their families. We have had challenges dealing with the different LMEs- particularly when a child moves to and from foster placements- which means dealing with 1 or 2 different LMEs. Under the current proposal w 1115, we would have to deal w 15 payors, 15 credentialing bodies, 15 enrollment processes. This would be formidable and definitely compromise care to this difficult population for whom there is already a severe shortage of providers. Please continue the CCNC model and stop this 1115 proposal."
"Dear CMS,

I am writing in regards to my concern about children's access to their pediatrician should this Waiver be approved. I chose to work in North Carolina because it is a place where I can see all the children in the community. When I talked to pediatricians elsewhere either you work in a practice that takes private insurance or you work in a ""Medicaid"" clinic. In my clinic in New Bern we are privileged to see children with Medicaid alongside children with private insurance. Most children with Medicaid and North Carolina are seen in private practices like ours. Medicaid pays substantially less per visit. This is partly offset by the lower cost of claims management due to 1 payer with consistent policies and payment schedule. The waiver plan will have us contracting with at least 5 different managed Medicaid organizations. Each will have a different claims management policy. Most Medicaid managed care companies, from what my colleagues tell me in other states, give them the same headaches as private insurance. Lower reimbursement rates and elevated claims management expenses will require us to limit our Medicaid exposure in order to remain solvent.

Our sickest children are on Medicaid- it pains me to contemplate choosing between their welfare and being able to pay my staff. Our practice, like most pediatric practices, exists on a very slim margin. I work in North Carolina because through my residency and professional career the Pediatric Society, Community Care North Carolina and the Department of Health and Human Services all pulled together to create the best care we can for the children of our state. This waiver, whether on purpose or by accident, is designed to destroy the pediatric medical home as it has been developed for the last 30 years.

"Hundreds of thousands of North Carolina citizens do not have medical coverage, but they could if North Carolina would elect to expand Medicaid as allowed by the ACA. It is unconscionable that, as a state government, we have intentionally determined not to accept the insurance care that people deserve, simply for political reasons. Even when other states who are represented by Republican governors and legislatures have determined that it is in the best interest of their citizens to expand Medicaid, North Carolina has not done so - we have failed to close the gap for partisan reasons and, we've even done so at the cost of thousands of jobs, and the lost of billions in tax money that now goes to other states. In effect, we have decided to cut off our nose to spite our face, even when we know that the insurance to take care of that injury is not in place! How irresponsible to we want to continue to be?? Let's close this gap now and move on to other issues that are important to our state's people and its economy."
"I am a parent in NC and Administrator for a large pediatric physician group. I am against the Medicaid waiver proposed by NC. The current NC Medicaid system is nationally recognized for quality care, access, and cost containment. The proposed changes will destroy the efficient system that has been built here in NC and replace it with up to 15 for profit, MCOs that will add unnecessary complexity and inefficiency. Pediatricians will not be able to continue seeing medicaid patients in an ineffienct system as the reimbursement for Medicaid patients is already 1/2 of a private insured patient. Efficiency is key to pediatric survival. Approving the waiver will result in pediatricians limiting their access to Medicaid enrollment. At a minimum, children should be excluded from any experiement that CMS wants to perform with a waiver."
"North Carolina currently has a model program to provide outstanding care to all children. Privatizing NC Medicaid would shunt money to out of state for-profit corporations rather than using it to improve care in NC. Already, many providers refuse to care for children covered by NC Medicaid due to the low reimbursements. Privatizing it would only drive reimbursements lower, and even fewer providers will be able to provide care. The only winner in that scenario would be the for-profit corporation's executives and shareholders."
"I am pediatrician and we donot support this waver because it will restrict patients choices and reduce services provided to Medicaid beneficiary. To many Managed care organization will create bareer to our reimbursements and increase denials, reduce fees paid to doctors, we won't accept Medicaid patients and patient will end up in emergency room or hospital inpatient and this will increase the cost of healthcare for all."
"I am a Pediatrician and have been caring for NC children for 36 years. I have readily accepted these patients for the reduced fees given for their care.I do not support this waiver and recommended changes….

Expansion of medicaid in NC, accepting more federal dollars to support the system, would IMPROVE access and care in NC FAR more than current recommendations in the waiver. NC has not chosen to do that thus far.

CCNC has been a well established program, that has over the past few years saved money and improved access to care for children in NC… Elimination of this program will reverse this trend

This is going to be a disaster for access for patients in North Carolina in both rural and urban populations.

90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall. CCNC in NC has improved tremendously care being delivered in the medical home, not in Emergency or urgent care environments, saving the system money.
Hugh M. Powell, Jr. MD FAAP"
"As a pediatrician in NC for the last 36 years and a provider for the most vulnerable group of children, Medicaid enrollees, I have tremendous concern for this proposed waiver to our current system.

Current budget for medicaid has 6% for administration. Waiver includes 12%, as ""for profit"" companies will need to have an operating margin. This extra 6% will likely lead to reductions in reimbursement for physicians, which will lead them to discontinue taking medicaid patients.

There is great concerns that with so many options for patients (up to 15) that those options that primary care pediatricians will accept may be different than what specialists will use, which will make referrals to needed specialists difficult to impossible.

This is not the right kind of waiver, bent on specifics for innovation for improved quality of care and access, which is already well above standard in the US, and this current waiver would NOT reach these goals.

Going from one unified medicaid systems to 12-15 different MCOs. There is no need to have that many in a state our size, with population or geographic size. Tennessee, which is similar geographically and in population, had 4.

transparency of current medicaid system, for communication and expectations, is BETTER than private insurance. Increased number of medicaid MCOs, with different rules, different formularies, and with an eye towards their own profit, will increase physician and office time in determining approved medications, and getting authorization for needed services.

Hugh Powell, MD"

"Dear Sirs and Madams,

If this reform proposal is judged to have merit, it should only be permitted to go forward with the condition that access to Medicaid services is expanded in the state. See attached the difference between Kentucky - which accepted medicaid expansion - and NC, which did not.

"I am an Office Manager for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina. There is no way our group supports the Medicaid waiver! We have worked diligently with Community Care Network and have had great success with their leadership. Allowing ""for-profit"" companies into our system will only weaken our Medicaid program and cause great burden on our coordination of care for our children. This burden will be too great for small practices such as ours. We have discussed pulling out of Medicaid all together should this process move forward as currently designed. We wish the State of NC legislators and CMS to understand that NC is currently poised for continued savings through an already stellar medical management team through CCNC."

I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can reinvent Community Care, especially if our practice has to deal with up to 15 different payers. Under Community Care, we deal with one payer and one community-based care coordination system. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services."

I am a practice manger at a independent practice with four board certified pediatricians in central North Carolina. I have worked at this office since 1982. We are approximately 65% Medicaid. We work hard to provide excellent care to all of our patients. I am not in favor of the Wavier and would kindly appreciate your NO vote on this. Until a better plan is laid out for a change such as this it would disastrous to our patient care and our practice. Thank you for your consideration. NO to wavier.
"I am a general pediatrician in Eastern NC who provides care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance.

I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program. In consideration of this waiver, you must consider a few things:

1. There is not a practicing physician who thinks this waiver would serve our population well. If Medicaid in NC is taken over by a variety of private insurance companies, it would be a disaster-- not only for the families to navigate but also for the providers. This added complication to working with several different private companies would lead to much worse access to care for our poorest families and children.

2. CCNC is a great program. It is a success and dismantling it makes NO sense. It would be irresponsible and NC would not be able to re-create such a successful program in the next 25 years. Losing our school based health centers in our highest poverty schools would also be likely with this waiver. That would be devastating to our school age children who benefit every day from these services, both physical health and mental health.

3. Legislators should realize that Medicaid is going to cost substantially MORE if this waiver is accepted. There will be more people accessing emergency services, which are VERY EXPENSIVE compared to office visits. As a pediatrician, my colleagues and I work hard to provide continuous and high quality care to infants, children and adolescents, and to keep them out of emergency departments. If the waiver passes and NC moves forward to dismantle the Medicaid system as our NC legislators propose to do, there will be no way to keep our families out of the ER for minor medical problems. I do not think legislators are thinking of this consequence with the proposed waiver.

Thank you for NOT accepting this waiver and doing what is best for NC children and families."

"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina, currently working primarily in Moore County and with past experience in Orange and Guilford Counties. I have serious concerns regarding the 115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services, two of which are detailed below.

In each community, I experienced the benefit of Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC). The coordination of care through the services provided are exceptional and tailored to meet the needs of the community. A program such as this will be hard for a private company to replicate, and even harder if there are many competing entities. Just in the past few weeks for my personal subset of patients, our clinic's care coordinator helped a high-needs patient transition from hospital to home care, conducted home visits for two patients with high health care utilization, and assisted in the care of a patient with severe asthma who has had care in multiple different hospitals and clinics throughout the state.

Our practice sees over 11,000 patients who receive Medicaid. The complications that will inevitably arise from having 15 separate payers will force our practice to make major changes, potentially freezing wages, forgoing hiring for needed positions, or decreasing the number of Medicaid patients we can see. In any of these scenarios, we will not be able to provide the best care for our patients, and the children of North Carolina will be the ones who suffer."
" -People in the health care gap get sick and need care, just like us the rest of us, and they must either go without care, including preventive and primary care, or rely on community health centers, or charity clinics; and then when things get super serious, they end up in the ER, which as we all know is the most expensive care. Health care access and equity should be the cornerstones of any reform plan.

The federal government has already set the money aside to pay for expansion, providing never less than 90% of the cost. Right now, our dollars are going to expand Medicaid in other states--states in which the results of expansion have already met or exceeded the estimates of outcomes: better access to care, earlier diagnoses for chronic conditions, overall cost savings, job creations, lower premiums, etc. It's an affordable, proven approach."

I work as a Clinical Manager in a 15 physician pediatric practice in North Carolina. Community Care of North Carolina has had a tremendous positive impact on our practice over the years and it would be a mistake to move away from this well functioning and established system. Not only has the current organization improved healthcare for our Medicaid population but we have also applied the same care coordination concepts across our entire patient population with many positive results. This nationally recognized Community Care organization has proven many times to be cost effective and produce results in improved patient outcomes. Moving to a multiple MCO system in NC would be an administrative nightmare and would result in less effective patient care.

I am a practice manager here in WNC and I in NO WAY support the change of the way Medicaid is delivered. CCNC has done a great job! With MCO's possibly coming on board it will be a DISASTER! They are for profit only! Certainly not doing it for the love our children!
I am a Practice Manager in a rural area with six Pediatricians. Our practice is 70% Medicaid. We cannot afford to have more reductions in Medicaid and still maintain a viable practice. Please do not try to fix something that is not broken! CCNC has done a great job and they are a model for other states!
managed care is not a good idea especially for pediatrics.
"I am a physician assistant working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient.

"I am the Executive Director of the largest pediatric Medicaid corporation in the state. Since the ACA reimbursement stopped January 2015, we barely meet our expenses from month to month. Our providers see approximately 166,000 visits per year that is represented by 78% Medicaid. If we have another reimbursement cut that is anticipated with the waiver, our ability to continue to provide care will be in great jeopardy. I am adamantly opposed to the waiver implementation in NC."
CCWNC is so important to our success in caring for our Pediatric patients. Please do not make the proposed changes to Medicaid for children.
I am a pediatric nurse practitioner and a practice consultant.

In pediatrics this will have a long term impact on the health and well-being of the population. Please deny the waiver.
making medicaid more complicated is not in the patients' best interest and would negatively impact health of children in western NC
"Hi, I work as a medical assistant and after listening to my providers talk about the changes in Medicaid, I thought I would put in my two cents. I feel that working in a field where it is all about the children we should always make that a top priority.

Please CMS reconsider this and tell our legislators that this is a bad idea and needs to be stopped."
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
First, any Medicaid waiver for our state should include a provision that NC expand Medicaid to the nearly half a million North Carolinians who currently fall into the Medicaid gap.
The NC proposal is flawed for several reasons. It fails to build on the nationally-acclaimed, cost-saving and quality-enhancing NC program, Community Care of North Carolina. Instead, it relies on privatization and capitation. And most important, it does not include Medicaid expansion.
I am a licensed and practicing physician assistant in North Carolina."
"I am a physician assistant in Robeson County. The waiver will be devastating to our practice! I care for many complicated patients that receive care from our specialists coming to our office from Duke, UNC, and New Hanover in Wilmington, NC. The waiver has the potential to divide the state in a manner that would restrict access to these specialists and greatly affect the quality care they receive. Please consider rejecting the waiver."
I am a practice manager for a pediatric practice with 13 pediatricians. Our NC system works great now and do not agree with new proposed system
"I am a parent of a child on CAP/C. She receives Medicaid through CAP/C. Many parts of this waiver are very concerning. The most important thing in healthcare is freedom of choice of providers. This plan does not ensure we will retain that choice. It divides the states into regions & limits participants to receiving care not only in their region but also to those providers who choose to participate in their plan. With so many plans providers will have to deal with, it is likely that many will just opt out of Medicaid altogether or only take one plan. Billing multiple plans is a hassle most will not want to deal with. I am wry concerned for people like my medically fragile daughter that their lives will be put in jeopardy because the providers most skilled in her rare disease are outside of our region & may also be out of her plan. She has so many specialists, it is not likely that all will participate in the same plan. This is further complicated by limitations of her primary care insurance network. We'd have to go to one in-network w/ our primary, but what if that provider was not also in her Medicaid plan network? In addition, unclear whether NC HIPP (NC's healthcare premium assistance program) will still be available. Without it, many families like mine with huge medical bills & expenses may have to drop our child's primary health insurance bc we can't afford the premiums. Then, Medicaid would be forced to pick up all of her bills. It is a fiscally irresponsible move for the state & for families!"

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"

Thank you for the opportunity to post comments. I am the practice manager of an independent pediatric practice in North Carolina. We are very happy with the current Medicaid system. Having a single point of contact and payer makes our practice more efficient and eliminates redundancies.

Please deny this waiver and save our Pediatric Medicaid Program. Thanks for listening.
"I am a pediatrician with offices in 5 cities in North Carolina - Raleigh, Cary, Holly Springs, Clayton, Wake Forest - We take care of many Medicaid patients .

We are currently getting less than Medicare rates for care of these patients. Already this is inadequate to cover overhead and operation costs. Current reimbursement is not adequate to cover salary of our physicians which we fortunately can supplement from the reimbursement from our commercial insurance companies.

In my opinion, the current waiver is DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE. As proposed, we would need to significantly increase overhead if we have to deal with many different companies that will handle insurance claims and also deal with different formularies, networks, etc. THIS WOULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE.

I absolutely not in favor of this waiver as proposed.

"I am a practice administrator for a 10 provider, private pediatric practice in western North Carolina. 60% of our patients are Medicaid recipients. We have been well served by the current Access Care Program that manages care coordination and payment for services. Their case management services have been invaluable, as many of these kids have significant health and behavior problems that are difficult to manage by the physician alone. They frequently need outreach for other issues like parenting, transportation, and compliance. Pediatrics is a very labor intensive speciality and many resources are needed to provide quality healthcare. Recent cuts in the Medicaid program in North Carolina have caused financial burdens to practices that have been heretofore unseen. This year, $154 million was returned to the NC General fund from the Medicaid program as a result of savings realized. This was done at the expense of physicians who are caring for the next generation of adults.

We functioned best when we were receiving 100% of Medicare reimbursement. The transition to managed care leaves so many unanswered questions about how we will be reimbursed, and what sort of care coordination and management will be available that we have no idea what to expect. Multiple meetings that we attended on the subject with various politicians left us with more questions than answers.

It appears to me that our current governor is selling us out to develop connections to the big insurance companies that will line the pockets of the politicians instead of making sure North Carolina's kids get the care they deserve. I enthusiastically vote NO for Medicaid Managed Care in North Carolina."
"I am a pediatric health provider, and I oppose the changes to Medicaid. The Community Care of NC (CCNC) system already in place is a model program for other states, and serves North Carolina's Medicaid population well.

I am in favor of remaining with the CCNC system.

"I am a PA working in Robeson County. I have a real concern about the Medicaid Waiver and the potential loss of Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC). Since its inception, CCNC has produced cost-savings for the state as well as remarkable quality outcomes for the patients that are nationally recognized. I am against any waiver that does not have CCNC as a major component."
"I have been a pediatric provider in Raleigh NC for 30 years. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients.

Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC. If we have not learned anything about healthcare in past 30 years we have learned the following: DON'T MAKE HUGE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM! CONTINUE TO TWEEK THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

I oppose the currently proposed waiver, please do not approve these significant, enormous changes to our our current system.

Care for our most vulnerable population will suffer tremendously."
"I am the Executive Director of a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in SE North Carolina. Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections.

It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."
"I am a pediatrician in a large group practice that sees patients that have Medicaid. I am very concerned about the proposed changes to NC's Medicaid plan. Other states that have privatized, for profit companies, managing their Medicaid have not had a good experience at all. This would likely also involved capitation which would be a huge disincentive for providers to take Medicaid patients. In addition, dealing with 15 different insurance companies with different metrics would be tedious and difficult to manage for practices and also difficult for patients.

"I am an outpatient pediatrician in Wake Forest, NC. I love caring for our state's children and am concerned about the proposed changes for Medicaid and how they will impact the access to care and coordination of care for my Medicaid population. In other states that have privatized Medicaid services, there have been struggles for both the patient and the physician to know what services are covered and how to be reimbursed for providing those services. CCNC is a very successful program and disbanding it is the wrong thing to do if you evaluate the data. CCNC helps us provide quality coordinated care that helps keep costs down. Dealing with 15 different insurance companies, all with different metrics and formularies, would be almost impossible to manage. With the help of the CCNC program, we now have imbedded mental health in one of our offices which has been a great benefit to our vulnerable Medicaid population. We plan to expand this to other offices, but if Medicaid is taken over by private insurance, this might not be possible.

Again, please reconsider this privatization of Medicaid and disbandment of CCNC.

"I am a practice manager at a pediatric ophthalmologist office. I am not in favor of positioning NC Medicaid to be managed by a third party, for profit organization especially under the claim that it will provide ""better care"" to its recipients. We have a strong relationships with our local pediatricians and most all offices that refer to us. They do outstanding work to provide medical homes through the CCNC program.
Bringing in a for profit agency may indeed result in less money spent by North Carolina (for a year or so) but given that they will strive to make a profit that will mean that less money is actually going to the care of the patient.
Children (those under age 18) in the NC Medicaid program are not the most expensive ones to take care of, yet they could pay the biggest price in the proposed changes. Perhaps looking to the high expense areas (nursing care, durable medical equipment) for reform could lend the best financial payback for the state.
As a specialty provider, we have seen vision care cast aside by the major carriers for many years. Even with ACA efforts in pediatric vision coverage, it has been a nightmare of hoops and red tape to provide basic, needed care for children. The NC Medicaid system has had some ups and downs with our specialty but the current system works and children benefit. Our practice is dominated by Medicaid patients and introducing changes that may inhibit our ability to provide acceptable standards of care could prevent us from going forward as an available provider.
This is our passion. You do not go into pediatric ophthalmology to make tons of money, but you do have to sustain yourself."
"I work for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina as a coder/biller and I do not support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now and I cannot imagine how much more complicated it would become for patients, providers, and billers having to deal with multiple entities. It makes since to stick with what works, even though we do have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than create more with a more complicated system. This would also impede our progress with getting patients with Medicaid the help they need from mental health providers."
I am a pediatrician in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver
"NC Medicaid and CCNC has been nationally recognized for its success and breaking down this model might do more good than harm. Moreover, with recent medicaid cuts, access to care has been significantly compromised with many private offices no longer accepting medicaid patients or have had to close down due to lack of financial sustainability. This in turn has increased the burden on emergency rooms which is a major contributor to rising healthcare costs. Hence, we urge you to revise provider
reimbursement rates and ensure they are comparable to Medicare rates to ensure access to care. I strongly urge you to place your focus where it is needed which is Medicaid expansion not reform . Thank you"
"Please require a Medicaid expansion with our waiver. It would benefit the medical system, the insurance system, and most of all THE INDIVIDUALS who need coverage!"
"As a medical student in NC who cares about access to healthcare for patients at all economic levels and as a NC resident whose family has fallen within the ""Medicaid Gap"" created by our legislature's failure to expand Medicaid, I hope any reform will include full Medicaid expansion."
"CMS - Please deny this disaster of a waiver!
I am a pediatrician in NC and belong to a large practice with 1/3 Medicaid patients.
I went to one of the ""public comment sessions"" held by NC DMA at several locations around the state to satisfy CMS's requirement that they solicit comments. Many of the comments were from pediatricians and ALL were asking the state NOT to kill the Nation's Best Medicaid program. I've learned that the same comments were made at all sessions across the state..
Despite the 99% negative comments received, the waiver was not materially changed! That should tell CMS that the state is unwilling or not allowed by the legislature to design a program that is equal to what we have! We are certain our payments will go down below the current 76% of Medicare and managing 5 to 15 Medicaid Companies all with different rules will be an administrative nightmare!.
With our current CCNC program, we have a substantial ""buy-in"" from physicians - especially pediatricians. ""Buy-in"" is required for a cost-effective successful program. This proposed program will be neither.
We currently have a cost effective program with an 8% reduction in PMPM over the past 5 years! Once the state loses the trust of the physicians - and that can happen in a single year of a dysfunctional program - it will take years to regain what we have now!
I understand a state has the right to totally implode their indigent healthcare system - but this time they need CMS's PERMISSION to do so! Just say ""NO!"" to this terrible ""solution"" to a non-existent problem! Or at least exclude the pediatric population from this disaster in the making! Pediatrics is NOT broken!
Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program.
Rebecca Wright, KidzCare Pediatrics, PC"
I work in a pediatric office in NC as a nurse and asst administrator. Our practice is 65% Medicaid population. I do not support this change.
"Dear CMS,
I was living and working in Northern Virginia when MCO's took over all Medicaid specialty care, it was a disaster! It took 3 times as long to precertify surgical procedures, MRI's, Cat Scans, etc and our reimbursements tanked by 30%! Unpaid claims rose by 25% to 35%. We had to fight claims denials for reimbursements and I finally threatened legal action to retrieve payments that were 24 to 36 months old. I finally received a check for 12k + for non-paid claims after fighting the MCO for 48 months. And, to add further insult and injury, the MCO folded not long after so we still lost money for claims that had not been processed and paid!
Wake up CMS! Do not further burden pediatricians and reduce our receivables even further, Pediatricians are being put out of business!
Concerned Pediatric Practice Employee"


"As a pediatrician practicing in rural north carolina, I am shocked that the legislature think dividing medicaid up into multiple entities is going to produce a better product for the children on North Carolina. Just stop and think about it. Each entity will have its own employees, accountants, CEO, infrastructure, and overhead, etc. These entities will be trying to make a profit. Most of these expenses will be duplicated between entities. As the medicaid pie is not growing, how on earth are these increase expenses going to be paid for? Let me tell you, by limiting services to the medicaid recipient and further decreasing reimbursement to those who provide services to the medicaid patients. The increase bureaucracy created by the multiple entities will increase expenses for the practices trying to treat patients with medicaid. More staff required to get referrals authorized, get the medication approved, get the xray ordered. Each entity will have different requirements and different protocols which will create a more complex system for the providers to navigate. This cost the providers more money, while our reimbursement will continue to decrease. Many will walk away from medicaid. I can't say I will blame them.

The current system is not broken. There are many tweaks that could be made to save money. Don't blow the whole thing up and hope that what is left is going to be fertile ground. What you are going to find is a wasteland where providers will not touch medicaid and the pediatric population is hurt."
"As a life-long resident of North Carolina, I urge the state of North Carolina to expand Medicaid to all state residents under 138% of the federal poverty level. In order for NC Medicaid and NC Health Choice 1115 Demonstration Waiver to be truly innovative and address community health needs, the waiver should include Medicaid expansion. Without expansion, up to 500,000 North Carolinians will continue to go without access to quality, affordable health care. This year, nearly 50,000 women will not receive recommended preventive screenings, 27,000 diabetics will not be able to get necessary medications, and 144,000 children will remain uninsured because their parents lack access to coverage. Clinics and hospitals, especially in rural areas, will continue to be financially vulnerable because of uncompensated emergency room costs. If hundreds of thousands of low-income residents remain in the Coverage Gap, North Carolina cannot truly address prevention, health equity, or social determinants of health. North Carolina Medicaid reform must include Medicaid expansion.

The waiver does nothing to address the half million people without health insurance."
I work in a Pediatric office in NC as a nurse and I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities. I feel like this is not the best choice for Medicaid.
I work in a Pediatric office in North Carolina as a nurse. I do not support the switch from single Medicaid to 15 different entities. We have the best Medicaid program in the country!
I am a PA working in Robeson County and am greatly concerned about the lack of quality issues involving the waiver. I am opposed to any change to the current system due to this.
"Not only do I believe that healthcare is a human right, I also think that maintenance of good health in communities increases productivity and reduces the exacerbation of other social issues such as poverty and hunger. Please take seriously the opportunities to reform and/or expand Medicaid in order to increase coverage for thousands of North Carolinians."
managed care is not good for pediatric patients on medicaid
"Please expand Medicaid coverage so that every person in NC has access to the medical care they may need, irrespective of their income level. If you have brought yourself up out of poverty, you should not be shoved back down into it because of medical bills."

I am the Executive Director of a pediatric group in three SE North Carolina counties. I am concerned about how patients will be assigned to providers under the new waiver. NC adopted an auto-enrollment system recently that has been a complete and utter disaster. Patients that we have been seeing since birth and have a strong relationship with have suddenly been assigned to another office that they have never been seen before. Any waiver that does not have a well-conceived method for patient assignment should not be considered by CMS.
"Today, Congressman David Price (NC-04), Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12), and Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) sent a letter urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reject the McCrory administration's request to reorganize and partially privatize North Carolina's Medicaid program. The State of North Carolina's request, known as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population. Please find our letter attached."
"I WORK FOR A MEDICAL OFFICE AND SEE WHAT FIRST HAND THE DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE IF THIS IS APPROVED. MANY OF US, CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, WILL SUFFER WITH JOB LOSSES AND TERMINATED HEALTH CARE SUPPORT. ELDERLY AND MINOR CHILDREN THAT ARE LEGAL CITIZENS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS ACTION. MANY CITIZENS DEPEND ON THE HELP OF MEDICAID FOR MEDICAL SERVICES AND HAVE WORKED THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS OF THIS MUCH NEEDED HELP.I AM VERY DISTURBED THAT THE MEDICAID INTENDED FOR US CITIZENS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT APPLIES FOR IT WHEN OUR OWN PEOPLE ARE TURNED AWAY. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY AND PEOPLE, PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS REFORM."
"I oppose any change to Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC). CCNC is a unique approach to delivery of Medicaid health care to NC children that has improved both access to care and quality of health care while reducing costs. As President-Elect and President of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2001-03) it was my privilege to travel throughout the U.S. Wherever I traveled, I heard the complaint that For-Profit Prepaid Health Plans managed COSTS, not care. Later, as a Board member of a regional component of CCNC every agenda included 1)Improving quality 2)reducing cost. E. Stephen Edwards, MD, Raleigh, NC"
"I am acutely aware of how a single diagnosis can destroy a family. Putting off annual visits because of cost, and letting small problems turn into uncurable ones can result in financial ruin, not to mention it can greatly harm the children whose parents fall into this category. The Medicaid expansion dollars have come out of my pockets just as they have out of the pockets of other taxpayers. It makes no sense for our state to refuse these dollars and as a result risk the health of many of our most vulnerable citizens. In a state where Medicaid expansion could help thousands and could create thousands of jobs, leaving the expansion out of the formula does a disservice to our stated. I urge you to included Medicaid expansion NOW. Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. Thank you in advance for showing that you care."

"I believe NC's plan to reform Medicaid should include closing the coverage gap. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was originally written to include individuals of all income levels. Those below a certain income were to receive Medicaid. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state to cover those individuals, North Carolina opted not to expand the program, stating that the Medicaid system was broken and needed to be overhauled.

To date, the state of North Carolina has rejected over $4.5 billion in Federal funds which would have provided coverage to over a half million of our neighbors, family and friends. Even after three years, the state will never pay more than 10% of the cost to cover these individuals.

It's time to close the coverage gap."
"I am a pediatrician in rural North Carolina, and approximately 35% of our patients have Medicaid. The proposed waiver would be a disaster for patients, their families and the providers who serve them. Creating multiple PHP's (Prepaid Health Plans) in each region will greatly increase administrative burden on practices with a large percentage of Medicaid patients. As a result, many practices will likely reduce the number of Medicaid patients or close their doors, thereby greatly reducing access to medical care for our most vulnerable patients."
"HI I'M A EMPLOYEE OF PEDIATRIC CLINIC AND I'M CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT POSSIBILITY OF THE WAVIER PROGRAM...I FOR ONE RECEIVED MEDICAID FOR MY CHILDREN AND CAN NOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE AND I FEEL THIS DECISION WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY ME BUT MY CHILDREN AS THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED AND NOT ABLE TO SEE THE SPECIALITY CLINICS THEY NEED FOR ALLERGIES, AND OTHER THINGS THAT MAY COME UP IN THE FUTURE. IT HAS BEEN A HUGE BURDEEN LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS KNOWING I WAS ABLE TO GET MEDICAID AND NOT HAVE TO SACRIFICE MY CHILDRENS AND MY NEEDS TO PROVIDE UNAFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. MEDICAID HELPED ME AND RELIEVED THAT BURDEEN AS FOR I AM A SINGLE PARENT AND NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET AND IF THE WAIVER GOES INTO EFFECT ME AND MY CHILDREN AND MILLONS OF OTHERS WILL BE EFFECT BY THIS DECISION."
"As a mother of two children with chronic asthma it is important for my children to receive special care. Asthma issue is highly dangerous and the medicine is highly expensive. Many problems occur when the season changes causing issues with sick children.Therefore, it is important to keep CCNC alive so my child can receive the care that is needed."

HI IM CONCERNED WITH THE POSSIBLE WAIVER PROGRAM GOING INTO EFFECT. I LIVE IN A POOR COUNTY THAT THIS WILL EFFECT HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN AND ELDERLY WHO DEPEND ON MEDICAID AND MEDICARE TO GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED AND W/O IT I FEEL WE WILL HAVE A HIGHER DEATH RATE AND MORE CHILDREN AND ELDERLY GOING W/O THE CARE THEY NEED TO BE HEALTHY AND PROPERLY CARED FOR. SO I THINK OUR YOUTH AND ELDERLY IN POOR COMMUNITIED NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN MAKING THESE DECISIONS.
"HELLO HAVE YOU CONSIDERED HOW THE POSSIBLITY OF THE WAVIER WOULD EFFECT THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. WITHOUT MEDICAID THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BEEN SEEN AT THE DOCTOR. I KNOW ITS ONLY A WAVIER AND THEY WILL STILL HAVE COVERAGE, BUT THIS COVERAGE WILL BE LIMITED AND THERE NEEDS MAY NOT BE MET, WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY IN A BAD POSITION W/O FAMILY IN THERE LIVES AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH, AT LEAST WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG OR IS NOT JUST RIGHT THEY NO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO THE DR. W/O HAVING OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES THEY CAN NOT AFFORD. LETS THINK OF THE LESS FOURNATE CHILDREN THIS WILL AFFECT,."
"Foster care is very important in Robeson County area. In the clinic I work in everyday, we see a lot of children in foster care. With the issue with medicaid what would happen to the care of those children. Many would suffer due to lack of well child visit. Many would get sick and many would even get lose in the systems. Therefore, keeping medicaid would help those children see the care they need."

"I strongly urge you to include Medicaid Expasion in North Carolina's Medicaid Reform package. One in five adults under 65 in our state are uninsured! I know people personally who are not insured, and it's because they cannot afford insurance. We will lose $25 billion dollars in Federal matching funds between 2016 and 2020 if we do not expand Medicaid this year. Why do we choose to throw those dollars away, lose jobs. I have many friends who are hard working, community minded adults, especially small business folks, who do not qualify because of the gap and can't afford private pay health insurance. They need help now!"
HELLO I AM A EMPLOYEE WITH A PEDS OFFICE AND THE POSSIBLITY OF THE NEW WAIVER PEOGRAM COULD CAUSE POSSIBLE LAYOFFS WITH IN MY COMPANY AND COULD CAUSE NOT ONLY MYSELF WHO IS A SINGKE MOTHER AND HAVE TO CHILDREN DEPENDING ON ME. BUT ALL MY OTHER COWORKERS COULD BE AT RISK OF LOSING THERE JOBS AS WELL. WE NEED JOB SECURITY TO KEEP US EMPLOYED THROUGHT THESE HARD TIMES. SO WHEN CONSIDERING THE WAIVER CONSIDER OUR ECONOMY AND THOSE IT WILL AFFECT.
I know a family who father is suffering with cancer. He has two kids.He is not able to work and causing them to not able to have insurance expect medicaid. What would happen to those children who already suffering due to cancer related issues. Medicaid helps them to be seen by physician and possible prevent another possible case of cancer.
I am a pediatric extender and I do not support this waive.
"HELLO I'M SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW WAIVER THAT MAY GO INTO AFFECT, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ALL THE MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT MAY LOSE SOME OF THERE TREATMENTS OR MAY BE DENIED TREATMENT BECAUSE THERE NOT IN THE RIGHT ZONING. IN A WORLD LIKE WE LIVE IN TODAY MENTAL ILL PATIENTS THAT DO SEEK HELP AND ARE GETTING HELP NEED THERE SERVICES AND MEDICATION TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THERE DAY AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE AND KEEP AS SANE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM AND OTHERS AROUND THEM."
I work in a clinic that sees 75% medicaid patients. Due to the county being a slow economical down fall. Those patient are servelly sick. Some needs epi-pens because they are allergy to nuts etc. Medicaid provides that medicine for them. In not taken those meds that child could die. Medicaid is very important in our county.
"HELLO IM TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSILITY OF THE MEDICAID WAVIER THAT MAY BE UPCOMING. I HAVE A CHILD WHO WAS DX W/ ADHD AND HE WILL SOON BE STARTING KINDERGARTEN AND W/O HIS MEDICATION HE IS UNABLE TO FOCUS AND GRASP LEARNING. BUT WITH MEDICATION HE IS SUCH A SMART BOY THAT LOVES TO LEARN, READ AND DO MATH AT 5, HE HAS A PASSION FOR LEARNING. IF THIS WAIVER WAS TO GO INTO AFFECT IF COULD AFFECT MY CHILD W/ MEDS AND F/U APPTS AND ANY REFFERALS HE MAY NEED IN THE FUTURE. MY CHILD DESERVES TO BE SUCCESFUL AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD HIS MEDS W/O MEDICAID. HE IS ALSO A TRUE ADHD PT. NOT JUST DX AS ONE BC HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO BE WELL BEHAVED AND MANNERED BUT NEEDS THAT HELP TO STAY FOCUSED. PLEASE CONSIDER PT.S LIKE MY CHILD WHO THUS WAVIER WILL EFFECT."
My job is very important to me. I work at a pediatric clinic in Robeson County. This job brings security not only for my family but my coworkers also. Medicaid funding helps basically pay my bills.
At our local clinic we are 78% medicaid patients. Those patients are also referred out to other specialty clinics due to mental problems. Those patients needs there medicaid to receive help. A mental health patient suffer tremendously without there different medications. Therefore this wavier is for the support for medicaid in mental health.
"HELLO HAVE YOU CONSIDERED OTHER OPTIONS TO LOWER THE COST OF MEDICAID EXPENSES BEFORE GOING THROUGH WITH THE DRASTIC CHANGE OF THE WAVIER. TELEMEDICINE WOULD BE A HUGE HELP, EXPECIALLY HAVING THIS AVAIBLE IN ALL SCHOOLS AND HAVING THEM RAN BY THE SCHOOL NURSE WITH CONTACT THROUGH THE LOCAL DOCTOR. THIS WOULD HELP WITH LESS IN OFFICE VISITS AND HELP WITH SICK KIDS WHOSE PARENTS DONT HAVE TRANSPORTATION. THIS WILL BE A SOLUTION TO KEEP MEDICAID THE SAME WHILE GIVING MORE EFFECT OPTIONS TO HELP THE SOLUTION NOT MAKE IT WORSE FOR OUR CHILDREN WHO DEPEND ON THIS."
I am a employee at a pediatric office and the majority of our patients have medicaid. With this new reform we are concerned with all the changes that will take place. One concern is the possibility of possible layoffs. We are a big asset to our community and this reform would hurt our community in many ways.
"I believe that the inclusion of Medicaid Expansion in this demonstration is critical to enable additional heath care coverage to North Carolinians, particularly to the additional 144,000 children that would benefit from Medicaid Expansion in our state.
Thanks for reviewing my comment."
"HI, IM CONCERNED FOR THE WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE OUTCOME THIS WAIVER WILL HAVE ON THEM, I LIVE IN A COUNTY THAT IS POOR AND RELIES UPON MEDICAID AND MEDICARE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. ITS NOT THE FACT THAT ALL OF USDONT WORK BECAUSE LIKE MYSELF I WORK EVERYDAY BUT I STILL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING ENDS MEET AND CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH INS. SO MEDICAID HAS RELIVED THAT FOR ME AND PROVIDED MY KIDS WITH INSURANCE. BUT IF THIS WAVIER GOES INTO PLACE IMCONCERED THAT QUALITY OF CARE AND PREVENATIVE CARE WILL BE LACKING AND WE NEED AWESOME CARE FOR OUR KIDS AND ELDERLY."
"In the future the providers would love to video cam with nurses at local schools to help with sick patients. I would save time and money for the nurse staff, family and doctors. Medicaid patients could receive these services but if medicaid is cut out what would happen to the kids. Therefore, medicaid plays a important role int eh healthy way in our children's lives."
"I currently work at UNC Childrens Hospital, where we provide the bulk of our care to the pediatric population in NC. the majority of our patients are medicaid. Our administration is confident that this bill will limit the ability for us to continue to care for this majority of patients by increasing the administrative headaches required for patients to achieve the optimal care. I am certain that this will result in limitations in access for many patients, who will potentially drop through the cracks.
In my role as surgeon-in-chief of the NC Children's Hospital, I strive to make it as easy as possible for patients that need surgical care to get it. Reimbursement is not the only goal in play with this legislation. By simply making it more difficult to gain access to care, this plan will ration care in a way that those who need the most help are likely to be the least able to navigate the new system.
We do not support the new plan.

"As a pediatrician who serves a large number of Medicaid patients, I am deeply concerned about the proposed NC Medicaid reform as described in the waiver. The North Carolina Medicaid Program is a national model and one of the top programs in the country. While private insurers' premiums in North Carolina have increased by double digits annually over the last several years, the cost per patient of those served by NC Medicaid has actually decreased! The North Carolina Medicaid program should be emulated all over the country, not reformed in a manner as described by the waiver."
"Medicaid must provide for fair, timely payment to healthcare providers: We take caring for children seriously. But we are also a business and we need to be paid fairly and on time to make payroll, buy supplies, make rent-- all the things that it takes to run a business."
"PLEASE DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND KEEP MEDICARE THE SAME OR BETTER IT BY PAYING THE PROVIDERS AS NEEDED AND ON TIME. WE NEED THIS FOR JOB SECURITY AND FOR OUR YOUTH AND ELDERLY NOT EVERYONE IS RICH AND HAS MONEY TO SPARE, SOME OF US LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND HAVE BILLS AND MOUTHS TO FEED. PLEASE CONSIDER EVEYONE"
Why o why r my fed tax dollars going to help people in other states when my neighbors need help in North Carolina why?
"PLEASE THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE DISABILITIES AND RELY ON MEDICAID AND NEED CARE AND TREATMENTS, AND WOULD NOT GET IT ANY OTHER WAY WITHOUT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. PLEASE EXPAND MEDICAID NOT FOR YOU NOT FOR ME BUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT MOST."
"How the patients is assign due to the way medicaid has place the patient, a patient that has been going to the same clinic since birth, that patient is place somewhere else. The providers can not provide care if they don't know how to follow up. Therefore, the patient is not getting the care they need."
I feel that the new reforms will hurt our current patients ability to be able to continue to see the providers they have seen all their lives with the new assignment guidelines.
"Please make any approval of North Carolina's Medicaid Reform waiver application conditional on NC expanding Medicaid.

The most disturbing result of NC's failure to expand Medicaid is the estimated 375,000 people who have been left uninsured, even though the majority of them have jobs. According to the Cone Health Foundation, more than 1000 of them will lose their lives due to injury, disease, and chronic conditions each year without Medicaid.

In addition, four rural hospitals have already closed in our state due in large part to reduction in uncompensated care funding. Over $6 billion in federal fundin has been lost in NC in 2014 and 2015, due to failure to expand Medicaid, and estimates suggest that an additional $21 will be lost between 2016 and 2017."
I feel that the reforms will hurt job security of many staff members in the medical clinics due to cuts in funding.
"I currently work at a very large pediatric office and the majority of our patients have medicaid. Our administration is confident that this bill will limit the ability for us to continue to care for this majority of patients by increasing the administrative headaches required for patients to achieve the optimal care. I am certain that this will result in limitations in access for many patients.
Reimbursement is not the only goal in play with this legislation. By simply making it more difficult to gain access to care, this plan will ration care in a way that those who need the most help are likely to be the least able to navigate the new system.
We do not support the new plan."
I feel that the reforms will hurt preventative care for patients due to their inability to be seen.
"Low income, not enough jobs and other factors play a role in wanting to expand Medicaid in North Carolina. Medical cost is extremely high and not being able to go to a doctor causes consumers to use the emergency room. Preventive care is the answer and having expanded Medicaid in this State helps put North Carolina in the know."
It is very important that the NC's plan to reform medicaid should include CLOSING THE COVERAGE GAP
I have concerns that the new reforms will hurt patients ability to see specialists.
I'M A NURSE I WORK IN A PEDIATRIC CLINIC WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO ARE HIGH RISK FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.
I feel that the medicaid reform will hurt job security of many staff members in the medical clinics due to cuts in funding.
I have concerns that if the new healthcare waiver passes then it will end the CCNC ability to support our patient base
I AM A NURSE AT A PEDIATRIC OFFICE AND I AM TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAIVER. IT COULD AFFECT MY JOB SECURITY
"I am the Executive Director of a pediatric corporation that is 78% Medicaid in NC. I am concerned about the lack of support that the proposed waiver has concerning patient-centered medical homes. We have 4 sites, all of which are level 3 PCMH recognized. There is a lot of work that goes into becoming recognized and the quality of care delivered is enhanced greatly. Without a recognized incentive to being a PCMH, the great movement that NC is leading the nation in will probably go away. I cannot support such a waiver and hope that CMS feels the same."
"WE NEED TO CONTINUE MEDICAID SO PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO GET THEIR WELL EXAMS AND STAY HEALTH, SO THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE."
I AM A NURSE AT A PEDIATRIC OFFICE AND I AM TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAIVER. IT COULD AFFECT MY JOB SECURITY
I work at a pediatric office in robeson co and concerns about the CCNC. If the waiver passes our patients will lose their benefits and co workers will lose their jobs. Whats gonna happen to our patients to this wavier passes.
I have concerns that if the new healthcare waiver passes then it will hurt the clinics that provide primary care ability to be reimbursed for their services.
I WORK WITH ALOT OF HIGH RISK PATIENT IN MY PEDIATRIC OFFICE AND THIS WAIVER WOULD AFFECT THERE CONTINUITY OF CARE.
WE NEED TO CONTINUE WITH MEDICAID SO OUR PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO BE REFERRED TO SPECIALTY CARE IF THEY NEED IT.
I have concerns that the new delivery system under the healthcare waiver will complicate clinics abilities to deliver care.
"With recent medicaid cuts, access to care has been significantly compromised

with many private offices no longer accepting medicaid patients or have had to close down due

to lack of financial sustainability. This in turn has increased the burden on emergency rooms

which is a major contributor to rising healthcare costs. This reform will not benefit our patients, we do not support this reform."
MEDICAID NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED SO CHILDREN WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.
"I am a physician assistant working in Robeson County. I cannot support the proposed waiver because it does not address the integration of behavioral health. Many years ago, NC decided that they were going to reform the state's mental health system. Since the implementation of the reform, the mental/behavioral health systems have been a real mess. Access to care has essentially been non-existent, leaving many children and adults without the proper care and relying on the emergency departments to receive very fragmented care at best."
I feel like this wavier is gonna hurt alot of people. There are alot of kids that need these services and and parents as well
"The proposal for North Carolina's proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration the Governor and the Department of Health and Human Services reads well on its surface but is really underneath an ideological driven plan to move vital health care services for the poor from a public to a privately delivered, for profit system.

The performance record for the latter is not good. This is a state which has refused to expand Medicaid which would cover around 500,000 working-poor individuals who can't afford to see a doctor and as a consequence can often lead to serious illness or death.

The Governor has quite a nerve to submit this proposal, when failing to expand Medicaid, to further in my view bring a flawed for-profit approach to serving this population in my state. I totally oppose this reform.

I hope CMS will see the true intention behind this so-called 'reform' and reject it on its face."
CONTINUING MEDICAID WILL HELP PROVIDE JOB SECURITY TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS LIKE MYSELF.
IF THIS WAIVER PASSES IT WOULD BE VERY DEVASTATING TO MY PEDIATRIC PRACTICE. MY OFFICE CARES FOR MANY COMPLICATED PATIENTS THAT RECEIVE SPECIALISTS CARE FROM ALL OVER NC
PLEASE CONSIDER REJECTING THIS WAIVER. IT WOULD DRASTICALLY AFFECT OUR PEDIATRIC PATIENT CARE.
MEDICAID NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED SO IT CAN PROVIDE QUAILTY AND PREVENTATIVE CARE TO OUR PATIENTS. WITH OUT MEDICAID THEY WON'T GET THE CARE THEY NEED.
This health care wavier is gonna cause a lot of people to lose their jobs due to the clinic's not receiving funding.
The health care wavier will make it harder to see specialist when needed. this is a concern of mine
PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS WAIVER PASS . IT WOULD DRASTICALLY AFFECT AND COMPLICATE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR OUR OFFICE AND FOR OUR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS.
"MEDICAID IS NEEDED, BECAUSE WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL THEY GOT MEDICAID AND WERE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR WELL CHILD EXAMS AND STAY HEALTHY."
"Medicaid Reform Law would not be a good ideal, why? Their will be an increase on lay off. As you and I both can see that there increase on lay off. I chose to be a health care worker for job security. Been a mother of a family you need a job you can depend and support on for you family."
"Please do not approve this medicaid reform. People who really need medical assistance, our most vulnerable, poverty-stricken populations, should have access to life-saving medical care. This reform will complicate the delivery system for offices and patients."
"I WORK IN A PEDIATRIC PRACTICE THAT IS 78% MEDICAID, THIS WAIVER WOULD AFFECT OUR REIMBURSEMENTS AND AFFECT OUR JOB SECURITY"
MEDICAID NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED SO CLINICS CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR THEIR SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED WHEN THEY WERE SEEN.
This health care wavier is a concern to me because some kids have behavior and /or mental issues that need to be took care of and parents needs these services
I WORK WITH PEDS IN RURAL TOWN IN NC AND WE WORK WITH SEVERAL COMPLICATED PATIENTS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL CARE . IF THE WAIVER PASSES IT COULD AFFECT HOW THESE CHILDREN ARE ASSIGNED TO A PROVIDER
MEDICAID HELPS THE STAFF KNOW HOW TO ASSIGN THE PATIENTS AS THEY COME IN TO BE SEEN.
PLEASE DO NO ALLOW THIS WAIVER TO PASS WE TAKE CARE OF SEVERAL FOSTER CHILDREN AND THIS WOULD AFFECT THEM DRAMTICALLY
This wavier is a concern to me because of new assignment provisions patients may not be able to see providers they have saw all their lives
Please help NC get Medicaid all that need it that can't afford medical insurance that under the proverty level.
"Working as a health care worker you see patient with mental/ behavioral issues. If this law where in force there would be a lot of patient with out there medication which would causes more crime, a lack of education and etc."
MEDICAID HELPS DELIVER CARE TO OUR COMPLICATED PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE.
I work in a pediatric office. Medicaid Reform will not work if it does not work for children and the medical professionals who provide their care. The proposed model does not adequately take child health into account and should not be implemented across North Carolina. I am against 1115 Waiver.
"I am the Executive Director of a pediatric group in SE NC that has 5 offices that account for 166,000 visits per year (78% of which is Medicaid) The State of North Carolina's request, known as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population. CCNC has been a fixture in NC since that 1990's with great outcomes for patients and cost-savings for the state. I cannot support any waiver that does not include CCNC as part of the solution."
"CCNC helps educate patient with asthma and etc., There jobs would be on the line if this law was to pass. For the area I leave in the patient and there families need to be educated and a demonstration on asthma patient."
"It is important that North Carolina closes the ""coverage gap"" by expanding Medicaid. As Director of Pharmacy Services for a large FQHC in central North Carolina, I see every day the difficulties imposed on the lives of patients who are unable to obtain Medicaid coverage. As an example, an uninsured diabetic patient, will usually need 5-6 medications plus diabetes testing supplies, totaling approximately $400-$500 per month. With Medicaid coverage, this patient would only have to pay small co-pays and would be assured of obtaining their medication. Without Medicaid coverage, this patient would only obtain a small amount of medication and would be a poorly controlled diabetic patient, would usually have numerous hospital admissions, and would incur extremely high medical expenses. This is a great example of the wisdom of expanding Medicaid in North Carolina. It will be extremely difficult to improve community health if 500,000 North Carolina citizens continue to go without access to needed medications to control chronic diseases such as diabetes. Expanding Medicaid in North Carolina is a must in order to improve the health of all of our citizens. Submitted by: Carl D. Taylor, Director of Pharmacy Services, Piedmont Health Services, Inc. Chapel Hill, North Carolina."
"I work in a pediatric office. By turning over the management of Medicaid to for-profit Prepaid Health Plans, the waiver proposal will most likely cause costs to rise, access to fall, and quality of care to dwindle. Requiring low income people to navigate a complicated health insurance system will not improve access. Requiring pediatricians to deal with multi Prepaid Health Plans will increase the administrative hassles and costs of providers, resulting in decreases in access and quality. The current Community Care of North Carolina program is a model for optimal access to care, high quality of care, cost-effective care, and efficient integration of the professionals who must collaborate to improve patient outcomes. This waiver proposal with fragment this very successful CCNC Medicaid program, and set health care of low-income people back at least 25 years.

I vote no for 1115 Waiver."
I am currently employed at a pediatric office in North Carolina. I am concerned about the new change in Medicaid for our state. My office is currently happy with the system and we are concerned with the direction that this is taking. We ask you to please reconsider and to consider the ramifications of this significant change.
"If this law was to pass, access to care would be affect. Been a worker at a pediatric office, there are kids that is sick all the time. Patient and there family needs to have access to care. We has a parents never know when we need to take our child to doctor. Sickness doesnt give us a time nor a date. This law would cut back on jobs and hour for this type of care."
"I urge you to consider these comments to support Medicaid Expansion in North Carolina as a condition for any degree of approval for North Carolina's Medicaid Reform application.
The best estimates suggest that a half million people in North Carolina would be covered under expanded Medicaid.

According to the Cone Health Foundation, among North Carolinians who might have accessed expanded Medicaid, more than
1,000 of them lose their lives to injury, disease and chronic conditions each year. If CMS will act to make any approval of North Carolina's Medicaid Reform waiver application conditional on this state expanding Medicaid, we can reverse these dire consequences for so many people in need.

I would strongly recommend against replacing the single payer system. Physicians already have to hire staff to process claims in what is a difficult process. Proposed changes would make this even more difficult.
"As a resident of North Carolina, I urge the state of North Carolina to expand Medicaid to all state residents under 138% of the federal poverty level. In order for NC Medicaid and NC Health Choice 1115 Demonstration Waiver to be truly innovative and address community health needs, the waiver should include Medicaid expansion. Without expansion, up to 500,000 North Carolinians will continue to go without access to quality, affordable health care. This year, nearly 50,000 women will not receive recommended preventive screenings, 27,000 diabetics will not be able to get necessary medications, and 144,000 children will remain uninsured because their parents lack access to coverage. Clinics and hospitals, especially in rural areas, will continue to be financially vulnerable because of uncompensated emergency room costs. If hundreds of thousands of low-income residents remain in the Coverage Gap, North Carolina cannot truly address prevention, health equity, or social determinants of health. North Carolina Medicaid reform must include Medicaid expansion."
"Access to specialty care helps out a lot. Been a patients mother this help save time, money and travel. The area that I live in there was no clinic for what the doctor refer her for. But the pediatric office have a specialty clinic on certain days. This was a help to all"
"I think that NC needs to expand the Medicaid program to reach the approximately 500,000 that were not covered when NC refused the Medicaid expansion under the ACA. I do not favor privatization of programs that cover Medicaid coverage as is being promoted by the current North Carolina gerrymandered government. I fear that these re-writes of programming will one profit the owners and will not be adequately monitored by current NC state authorities as has been shown by the lack of monitoring of the use of funds in charter school monies distribution."
Please provide health insurance for all people. It is hard to believe that this is even a debate anymore. There is nothing good to be achieved by denying people healthcare.
I work in a Pediatric Practice in North Carolina as a Practice Administrator. I do not support the Change!!!!!
"Reimbursement from medicaid needs to be enforce for a certain time frame. There are certain things a clinic must do in order for the office to function properly, supplies payroll and rent are the main ones.There are still clinic that haven't been pay from last year that needs to be paid."
"Exclude patients 0-19 yrs from Medicaid reform. The current system is user friendly for this population. Multiple MCO's will complicate the landscape and jeopardize access to quality medical care (including vaccinations). I have patients that travel from multiple counties to my county in Iredell because they cannot access the system due to low physician participation. Physicians will continue to opt out of Medicaid if the system becomes divided into multiple MCOs, or cherry pick the highest paying organization.

"I am a physician assistant working in an urgent care section of the ED for Vidant Medical Center. I routinely see patients with chronic illness, inadequately treated for years. These are often working poor who are in the gap between Medicaid and ACA participation. These are people not followed for previous cancers, severely hypertensive people, diabetics not able to afford Rx or using what a family member can share of their own meds. Medicine is sometimes affordable through discount plans but the access to a provider is limited by the cost of chronic visits. This is doing the patients and society no good. It is more expensive care when chronic disease has resulted in irreversible injury and the patient is rendered disabled and dependent on society. It is just wrong to treat anyone like this when as a state, we can do better. I believe it is punative and vindictive. Thankfully, many other nations have dismissed this poor care as an option. We should also."
I think it is ashamed that people on Medicare do not have the same courage. Remember those on Medicare paid in the system.
"The waiver is a classic Bait And Switch - Please save us and our patients from profit driven private companies.
The reason given for the waiver is not rational - the state thinks if 10+ Private Companies manage Medicaid, if there is a shortfall, the state will not owe their 30% of the cost. Not likely, and never twice in a row.The MCO's have done contracts with states before, and their lawyers will ""out gun"" the state's in the complex contract. Private companies do not exist to lose money. All they have to do is to DELAY PAYMENT for care! There is no penalty for partial payment of claims - only for non-payment. Or, just not approve care to be done or approve providers to do the care. That is what happened to our Mental Health program - the state paid on capitation and the companies figured out they could just sit on the money and they would never go ""over budget""!
Maybe for a year or two the private companies will ""lose"" money, but as soon as the state dismantles their infrastructure for handling Medicaid claims, the state will have NO option and the cost will sky-rocket up! Not hard to figure this out....
-Tax Paying Pediatrician"
"Please save us from this disaster of a waiver request!
Capitation works best when the patient can choose to go elsewhere if the service/quality is not up to standards. Capitation is literally unsafe for Medicaid patients since they have NOWHERE to go if the quality or service deteriorates to meet the payment level! Private carriers using Capitation know if they do not insure the service is reasonable, patients will leave.
Capitation at the patient level is hard to do!
This conversion needs to start small - start with the most expensive, out of control segment - the adult Medicaid. Children 0-18y are at a great place in NC - it is very unlikely that by irritating the pediatricians by dismantling the very effective CCNC they have put so much effort into creating, they will be ""helpful"" with the new entity. The MCO's demand that the pediatric age range be included - they know our costs are much more predictable and will use ""our"" money (ie, reduce our payments) to fund efforts in the adult side to save money. Children will be punished for doing so well over the past 5 years!
Please do not punish us - please just say ""NO"" to the waiver!

"I am a pediatrician in a small rural area in NC. We will not be able to deal with the proposed changes to the Medicaid system.
We need to leave the present system the way it is. It works well for us. And, you cannot do away with CC4C. They help us in so many ways and there is no one or no organization in this county that can do what they do. So many children in our county would go without much needed medical care and other services if they were not available to track down patients/families and fill in the gaps.

"You should deny this application for no other reason than the state legislature denied expansion of Adult Medicaid!
That Malfeasance by our legislature proves they cannot make rational healthcare decisions for our citizens. If they were capable of caring for our patients OR capable of making smart business decisions, they would have participated in the Medicaid Expansion as did the majority of states. CMS has some responsibility to improve the health care of the nation - Just because our legislature wants to drive the state into a brick wall does not mean you should hand them the keys to a car that can do it!
The current legislature would rather spend money to call an emergency legislative session 3 weeks early to pass the nation's most embarrassing and only Bathroom Gender Law! Talk about a law for a non-problem!
Pediatric Medicaid is NOT broken. Don't let them break us just to prove they can!
-Frustrated Pediatrician"
I trained at UNC for 3 years seeing a majority Medicaid patients and I work at a practice that serves a number of Medicaid patients in Wake and Johnston counties. The direction that the Medicaid program is heading is wrong for the state of North Carolina and its Medicaid patients. We need a component of what has been place for years with community based leadership and buy in. The previous structure was highly successful in treating our pediatric Medicaid population and we need a component of CCNC to stay in place. Please reconsider or the pediatric Medicaid population is likely to lose more and more good options as providers and practices

CCNC is a very successful program and disbanding it is the wrong thing to do if you evaluate the data.
Dealing with 15 different insurance companies all with different metrics and formularies would be almost impossible to manage.
Having 15 different insurance companies compete for business will make it more difficult for patients to understand their options and could effect access to care.
"With the help of CCNC program, we now have imbedded mental health in one of our offices which has been a great benefit to our vulnerable Medicaid population. We plan to expand this to other offices, but if Medicaid is taken over by private insurance companies who have not mental health benefits, this program will have to be eliminated."
"Mental health among children and teenagers is a serious issue in any state. However, in North Carolina, with the help of CCNC program, I have been able to get help for (and follow up with) patients and their families that otherwise would not have gotten mental health care. This program is invaluable to our practice."
"Dear CMS,
I am a pediatrician from Greensboro, NC as was my father. We have always accepted Medicaid patients as freely and treated them the same as all other patients ( with private insurance).
The proposed "" reform"" of the NC Medicaid system gives great promise of being a disaster. Going from a single payer system that works to a five-payer system introduces such complexity as likely to be over whelming to patients and providers alike. Overuse of the ER, increased difficulty getting consultants to see Medicaid patients, a deterioration of care, and chaos for the medical care for poor people seems likely.
I would recommend you not accept the proposed changes to the NC Medicaid program. For profit is not the answer- it is for the profit of the private insurers and their stockholders.

Sincerely, David M Rubin MD"
"I strongly urge the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in North Carolina as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. This expansion will give tens of thousands of North Carolinians access to health care that they presently lack and/or cannot afford. Not only is giving these people the morally and ethically righteous thing to do, it will create a healthier work force, reduce the strains on our state's emergency rooms, help keep rural hospitals afloat, and create jobs. The old adage that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" is relevant here because expanding Medicaid coverage will increase access to preventive care, the benefits of which include reducing serious illness and the long hospital stays and/or medical bankruptcies that are more likely to occur when large numbers of North Carolinians cannot get the preventive care they need. The expansion of Medicaid will also help reduce infant mortality. North Carolina has one of the U.S.'s worst infant mortality rates. If you believe, as many North Carolinians do in ""right to life,"" shouldn't Medicaid be expanded in North Carolina as a way to help prevent North Carolina babies from dying at a higher rate than babies in many other states?"
"I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the NC Medicaid Reform 1115 demonstration. While I understand that the waiver is intended to connect children and families in our state to better health options, I am deeply concerned that large and unacceptable numbers of those families will continue to be without access to health care under the currently proposed plan. I urge the NC legislature to expand Medicaid eligibility, as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, and provide essential health care access to those, some 300,000 individuals, who do not have other reliable options. These are individuals who are caught in gaps of eligibility for Medicaid and financial assistance in the health insurance marketplace. Reliance on charity, free/low-cost clinics and the emergency room for health care is simply not working. We all pay eventually when large numbers of our citizens do not have regular, reliable health care.

Re: Family Health
There is mounting evidence that childhood Medicaid eligibility ""significantly improves health, educational, and financial outcomes in adolescence and adulthood: (North Carolina Child Health Report Card, 2016; NC-Medicaid -Parent-Paper). One of the clearest findings is that parents's access to health care has direct and significant impact on the health of their children, in that insuring parents provides economic security, and when parents are insured, their children are more likely to be insured as well. When treatment for mental and physical health problems is accessible, people can get the preventative care that can so often avoid more serious and expensive conditions, hospital stays, workplace absences and even more extreme family disruptions .

North Carolina deserves the health and economic benefits that have been shown to accrue to ""expansion states"", as compared to non-expansion states. Expanded Medicaid is critical for the thousands of our citizens who are currently without reliable access to health care.

Thank you for consideration of these crucially important matters.

"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina. With CCNC we currently have a cost effective program with an 8% reduction in PMPM over the past 5 years! CCNC has the buy-in and support of the pediatricians of North Carolina. Like most pediatricians in the state of North Carolina, I am opposed to the Waiver and have concern that the plan proposed will impact the access and care for our most vulnerable pediatric patients."
"I am a practicing pediatrician in rural NC. We have had a successful Medicaid program here and I am very concerned about the current waiver. A host of MCO's providing insurance would become chaotic quickly. I suggest that the waiver be DENIED.
Thank you very much for your attention. Lori Langdon, MD, FAAP"
"As a private general pediatrician I am very disappointed in the recommendations for the NC Medicaid waiver. The current Community Care of NC system is very effective at coordinating care for my patients, is cost-effective, and is in fact considered a model system that has been emulated. The waiver will contribute to fragmentation of care and a significant increase in administrative management needs/complications for our offices."
"I am a Pediatrician in NC and formerly served as the Medical Director of the NC Managed Care program 16 years ago.I am opposed to the present waiver because it does nothing to improved quality and it is a smokescreen for it's real purpose which is purely a misguided effort to torpedo a very successful, cost effective award winning managed care program which has the support of the entire medical community called CCNC. The proposed waiver is an ""Alice in Wonderland"" document. It was put together by a team that was directed by the Legislature to create a document to convince CMS that it is an effort to improve quality. This document is full off inaccuracies and hypotheticals which are unachievable without the support of the medical community. This support is nonexistent. It talks about vague entities which would take years to develop whose functions are nebulous. It describes a MH system as being a model but which is presently abhorred by the medical community. The genesis of this waiver is based on inaccurate financial data , subsequently found to be inaccurate, coupled with personal vendettas by some members of the Legislature who were determined to get rid of an award winning, cost effective ,provider supported program called CCNC. I strongly suggest that it not be approved. Thank you for you careful review f the waiver proposal."
" -- I am a parent who cares about the health of the children of NC.
-- I oppose the NC Medicaid waiver.

"With the current Medicaid wavier the manage care organization in my area clinical review team has been violating individuals civil and ADA rights with no oversight of the state of NC or CMS. They have placed a number of families and individuals in harms way and cause some parents to be jailed. I find it offensive the MCO, DMA , and DHHS made a surplus of $ 136 million in State Medicaid while individuals lost needed services or never got them to begin with. I know from personal experience that the clinical review denied my son services due to him not being able to ""read or write"" which qualified him for the services to being with in NC. In the appeal process it was passed off as a ""glitch"" that ended up costing my name to be slandered in court, son's civil rights violated, and great cost in money and time while the system bullied and strong armed my family. At least we did not have to go to jail as another family in my area did while fighting for their child's services. My current view of the MCO system is that it violates, abuse, neglects, and exploit the families they serve and pockets the money for their own personal gain while individuals with IDD are placed in harms way. The gap in services will continue with small projects to give the general appearance of meeting the gap need for services. In the individual's service needs the clinical review team will continue to violate individuals in NC for profit with no regards state or federal laws of protection of one's civil rights. They will use their legal teams to continue to abuse them into having no voice in the process."
"I am a family doctor who has been practicing in NC for 11 years, caring for both insured, underinsured and uninsured patients. The NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration waiver request is flawed for the following reasons:

1. Capitated care will only reduce costs by limiting care

2. Corporate, for-profit management increases administrative costs

3. Competitive networks produce overlapping wasteful bureaucracies

4. Dismantles the Community Care of North Carolina's well-developed non-profit, award-winning, provider-led regional networks which had some of the lowest administrative costs and the lowest annual increase in costs in the US -- don't change what works!!

5. Lack of provision for North Carolinians who do not qualify for insurance (those left ""in the gap"", unable to afford insurance offerings through the Affordable Care Act's Marketplaces, often too poor even to qualify for any Federal subsidies for these products). Specifically, this program does not provide expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

For these reasons, I request that you do not allow this demonstration in its current form.

"NC needs to close the medical coverage gap that now exists for approximately half a million people, many of whom are working and still cannot afford basic health insurance. My friend of over 30 years has a 31 year old daughter who has been diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer. This young women has worked for most of her short adult life, but the ravages of this disease has left her unable to work, and COBRA has expired. She has just enough in savings to not qualify for ACA, and does not qualify for Medicaid. What will happen to someone in circumstances such as this? If NC had expanded Medicaid she would be able to have coverage. This is not just an issue of basic health care being a right, but makes economic sense for our state and for our hospitals, which are providing costly emergency care that most likely must be written off as a loss. NC cannot afford to not expand this service for humanitarian and economic reasons."
"As a physician in training who hopes to serve the communities of rural Western NC, I know that both I and my patients need Medicaid expansion in order to thrive. Rural practices are closing in droves because without Medicaid, many patients are unable to pay their doctors. This is a bad deal for entire communities, as the only providers in town can't keep their doors open.
Everyone deserves access to health care, and the gap that exists right now between ACA coverage and Medicad leaves too many people without options. The uninsured end up in hospital emergency rooms, and hospitals end up requesting increased tax payer support because of all of the uninsured patients they care for. So in the end, it is much less expensive and more humane to make sure everyone has insurance to start with, and can get the preventive care they need to stay healthy. In the end it will save money and more importantly, allow all the citizens of this great state to be healthy, productive members of their communities."
"Please read these comments seriously- these are exactly like the comments at the statewide DMA listening sessions; universally against this foolhardy change. There is ZERO support from clinicians for this change. I realize that CMS didn't get exact transcripts of the comments- but this is what they were like: Passionate for the care of children and infuriated by the callous disregard of child health experts by our state of NC General Assembly. We know a lot more about this than they do- and they ignored us.

Our legislators might believe that the MCO companies will bear cost overruns year after year without increasing cost to the state, but if they believe that they must also believe in the Easter Bunny. Our PMPM continues to decrease in the current system- it makes NO sense to abandon this winning team.

The experience in Iowa has been a disaster with their transition to mismanaged care medicaid.

Pediatricians ""showed up"" in the General Assembly and explained all this, at length, to the key legislators- they ignored us and listened to the lobbyists of the MCO industry. Some people are motivated by money- Pediatricians are mainly motivated by the desire to do what is best for children and that is why we are raising Cain and begging the Federal Government for relief from this foolish, money wasting proposal that will damage a generation of children and burn down the infrastructure we have created for quality care.

"Please reform Medicaid and expand the coverage gap. As a person who was temporarily making an annual income that just slightly exceeded the $11,000+ limit for coverage, I just needed a few months of health coverage to help me afford a few basic medications. I had just graduated and was working hard to find a job, but could only find temporary positions for a while. In Maryland, where I had come from, my health coverage was entirely taken care of while I was a student making almost no income and living on savings. But when I moved to North Carolina and was still searching for a job, I was told that my cheapest coverage option would be upwards of $300 -- and that was just for catastrophic insurance. How does it make sense that a person making little to no income should be asked to pay $300 per month for health insurance? Please expand the coverage gap, and provide fair and adequate coverage to the many thousands of North Carolinians who are struggling to get by and just need some help for a short time as they get back on their feet."
Medicaid should be expanded in NC.
"For all the well-known reasons that medicaid MUST be expanded in NC, I urge the current government to proceed immediately with expansion."
"Thank you for allowing me to comment on the proposed Medicaid Reform. My chief regret is that Medicaid expansion is not included, but I'm also concerned that the reforms will lead to smaller numbers of provider participation.

I am a practicing hospitalist in Stanly County, and see patients who likely would not require hospitalization were Medicaid expanded. I see others at a free clinic who wouldn't need to be there if NC were to expand Medicaid.

At the free clinic, I recently took care of a nurse that I previously worked alongside for several years in the emergency room. It stunned me to see that someone who spent years tending to others' health doesn't have access to real health care herself. She has suffered cardiac conditions that we are able to help with, but she would benefit from services we can't offer her. If Medicaid were expanded, this great nurse would have real health care.

I also see patients regularly in the hospital who would benefit from Medicaid expansion. For example, I see diabetics who present over and over in a critical state because they cannot afford their insulin. Not only would Medicaid help them live longer and better, it would decrease uncompensated hospital fees.

Finally, I would add my concern that the proposed reform may lead to physicians dropping out of the Medicaid provider network. In my community, I already see patients in the hospital who lack a PCP, because the only ones accepting new patients are those at an urgent care. I'm concerned that the transition toward managed care organizations would lead the ones already participating to drop out of Medicaid altogether, which would be tragic.

I'm greatly concerned that Medicaid reform proposals will hurt North Carolinians by providers dropping out of the program, and wish that we could offer them the Medicaid expansion they need."
"I am a general pediatrician in NC and I do not support the proposed Medicaid waiver. CCNC has been invaluable to my patients, improving their access to care, increasing continuity in their medical home, decreasing ED and UC visits while saving the system money. Let's do what is best for the children of NC."
"Have we learned nothing from recent history? The dismantling of our community based mental health care system to a managed care system in 2000 was disastrous for mentally ill patients and the system still has not recovered. We have people waiting days or weeks in ER rooms waiting for treatment. We are exporting our mentally ill children out of state to as far away as Florida to receive inpatient care. In these facilities there have been cases of sexual abuse and the state has no oversight authority.

Managed care means managing to make a profit. For profit medicine does not have patient care and good patient outcomes as its main objective. Our current Medicaid system has been touted a model for other states. The problems of the current system have been created by the legislature underfunding the program. It does not need to be privatized and divvied up between the 158 health care entities that have lobbyist who constantly stream thru the legislative building.
The poor and sick that need Medicaid can't afford a lobbyist to look after their best interest.

What is going to be done when a person under this proposed managed care?
Are they going to be denied or delayed in getting adequate testing to obtain a diagnosis? What going to be done to ensure delay or denial of care does not result in the progression of a disease to an unmanageable or fatal stage? What about a person who has cancer or a serious car accident that requires life long treatment and care, when the person's expenses exceed the allotted amount for that person, are they just going to deny treatment? What is going to prohibit rationed care. What is going to be done to insure that these companies are going to see that patients get the care they need?

Don't repeat the Mental Health Care Reform disaster. Tell the legislature to properly fund Medicaid and don't turn it over to the companies that have lined their pockets with millions in campaign donations and flooded their offices with lobbyists."
"My name is Ernesto Villareal, MD, and I am a pediatrician at Cary Pediatric Center. I do NOT support this waiver. You can read many of the other comments which all say about the same thing and how negatively this will affect the health of the children of NC. Please, do not pass this waiver."
"I am a pediatrician in NC and oppose the NC Medicaid waiver. I am disappointed that the feedback provided prior to submission to CMS was not utilized in the due diligence period to improve the plan. Th plan does not address how medical providers will deal with the onerous task of interfacing with 15 MCOs. It also does not plan out how to maintain access for children to providers and specialists or how specialist networks will structured to maintain continuity of care. The plan also does phase out CCNC. As a pediatrician, I strongly support CCNCs efforts to improve Medicaid in NC and do not feel that there can be a successful Medicaid program without it."

"As a Pediatric Practice Adninistrator for. a large group of private pediatricians with a practice panel of approximately 40% Medicaid and a tax paying citizen of NC, I do not support the waiver and respectfully ask CMS to please deny the waiver. The waiver is not good for children. The waiver is a waste of my tax dollars to reform a system that is already known as a national model for how to care for children the right way. Much of the hard work already done by the CCNC group is being torn apart in favor of for-profit insurance companies setting up their own MCOs. The waiver allows for up to 15 of these MCOs to design their own systems and seek participating providers and manage their care to contain costs. Please listen when I tell you pediatricians will NOT participate with multiple MCOs to compete for Medicaid patient enrollment. Much needed specialists will NOT participate in multiple MCOs. Why? The increased cost of managing patient care through a myriad of networks and rules will exceed the reimbursement. Reimbursement is 1/2 that of a private paying patient (especially since the Medicaid/Medicare parity from the ACA was unfortunately not sustained). Medicaid works in NC only because it is a well established and efficient system that most providers trust enough in which to still participate. Participating in multiple MCOs that are for profit and building their plans FOR PROFIT will not be efficient nor trusted and the ones that will be negatively impacted will be children of the poorest citizens in NC.

If you need more examples of why to deny, refer to how privatizing the NC mental health system in the past several years has ruined mental health services fo NC citizens, especially children, because I can tell you that many of the good therapists just choose not to participate with Medicaid now and those that do never know if they are getting paid from their local entity. Children in NC deserve better and this waiver is NOT better. I would also like to apologize for our legislators sending this waiver to CMS. The political processed failed. The overwhelming feedback from their sessions with citizens across the State was against the waiver. I can only assume the for profit MCOs were so generous with their campaign dollars that it has clouded their understanding of the issues and responsibility to listen to their constituents. Please CMS do not do the same, listen to those that know what works for NC Medicaid and DENY THE WAIVER!"

"I am a nurse in Robeson County. The waiver will be devastating to our practice. We take care of a lot of special needs children. We have specialists from Duke, Chapel Hill and Wilmington that come in our clinic to see these children. If this waiver happens and restricts access to these specialists, a lot of these children will not receive the quality of care they need. Please consider rejecting the waiver for the sake of our children."
"As a Pediatrician I DO NOT support the NC Medicaid Waiver. CCNC has been a great tool and support system for primary care services to children. Their track record is beyond stellar and should be utilized to manage our pediatric patient population, as well as adult! I am contemplating pulling out of Medicaid if this change occurs. I am small practice and cannot afford the extra staff and decreased reimbursement to manage just Medicaid recipients. PLEASE DO NOT CAUSE OF FURTHER HARDSHIP BY ALLOWING PRIVATE INSURANCES COMPANIES TO MANAGE OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM!"
"As an advocate for the bleeding disorders community, I feel strongly that NC needs to expand medicaid for all those individuals that have fallen into this gap. It is unfair to punish these people, which is what is currently happening."
I am a nurse in Robeson County. In our clinic we take care of lots of complicated children. We have specialists from different areas that come to our clinic to take care of these special children. Please consider rejecting the waiver!!!!
"I AM A PEDIATRIC PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT WORKING IN SOUTHEASTERN NORTH CAROLINA, ROBESON COUNTY. THE TYPE OF PATIENT SEEN IN OUR PRACTICE INCLUDE MANY WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONDITIONS REQUIRING CARE WITH MEDICAL SPECIALTIES FROM DUKE, UNC-CH AS WELL AS EAST CAROLINA AND NEW HANOVER WILMINGTON, NC. THE DIVISION OF THE STATE THROUGH THE WAIVER WOULD POTENTIALLY RESTRICTING ASSESS TO THESE SPECIALISTS AFFECTING THEIR CARE THEY WOULD RECEIVE.

"I work in a pediatric clinic in Robeson County. Specialists from Duke, UNC, New Hanover and Wilmington come to our clinic to take care of our complicated children. Without them coming to our clinic these children would not receive the quality of care they need. Please consider rejecting the waiver!!!!"
We process referrals for children to see specialty clinics in order to further their care. Our office has specialty clinics come to our location so patients have access here in their town. This ensures the patients have the best care and easier access when specific care is needed.
THE WAIVER WOULD GREATLY AFFECT THE CARE OUR PATIENTS RECEIVED WITHIN OUR PEDIATRIC PRACTICE LIMITING ASSESS TO SPECIALTIES FOR OUR MORE COMPLICATED PATIENTS AS WELL AS AFFECTING THE PRACTICE AS A BUSINESS AND THE EMPLOYEES..REJECT THIS WAIVER !
"I work in a pediatric clinic along side of a CCNC nurse, she takes the load off our providers when it comes to anything to do with our asthma patients. She follows them constantly, to ensure their well being and to make sure they are receiving the correct treatment."
Patients with mental and behavioral problems would not be able to improve in school or socially if they were not treated for their conditions. This causes a long term disadvantage to the patient.
I am a biller for a Pediatric office and I am not in favor of Private Insurance companies managing the North Carolina Medicaid system. I can for see this causing many problems. There will not be uniformity in billing and will require a lot of extra time. This will affect small practices in a big way. Taking care of our patients in a timely manner is our number one priority.
"Patients need access to care during nights and weekends. Some parents are unable to get their child to a healthcare facility until after work and this would eliminate their opportunity to help the child, because it is not the child's fault if they can not get themselves to a healthcare provider."
"I work within a pediatric corporation, where we see a large number of foster children. we see these amazing parents that bring these children into their own homes and care for them like they are their own kids. In my opinion there should be more funding for these families, take some of the burden off of the families."
I am an employee at an Pediatric office and the decline of Medicaid services would greatly put my job in jeopardy. Over eighty percent of our patients are covered by Medicaid. Our sole purpose of being in an office is to help these children not only physically but emotionally as well. These services allow these children to walk through our doors and receive the care they need. Any declination of theses services will put not only my job at risk but the health of those eighty percent of children.
I urge you to support Medicaid Expansion in North Carolina as a condition for any degree of approval for North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Waiver application.

"I have observed the direct effects of NC legislators choosing not to expand Medicaid, on children's education. I tutored a woman who was in a Literacy Council class. She was not eligible for ACA coverage, but would be for Medicaid, if it were expanded. Her chronic health problems, which could have been alleviated if she had health care, not only caused her to miss a lot of work (paid hourly), but one of her two high school age children would have to stay home to take care of her. These children missed MANY days of schools, seriously affecting their performance and their future."

I work for a pediatric office as a CNA and i do not support this change.deny this waiver.
"Working in a poor,rural community shows me that Medicaid provides care to those who would otherwise not have the chance to get help when needed. The use of the systems currently allow patients to be treated and referred to specialty clinics to get the best care possible. Taking this away would cause more health problems in communities and spread sickness."
Children are exposed to several other children on a daily basis which allows easy access for spreading disease and illnesses. If there are more restrictions on treating those with medicaid it would impact those without Medicaid because they would be in constant contact with children who were unable to be treated properly.
"I work in pediatrics everyday. In fact, in my office, 3 out of 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients."
I am in a rural community that relies mostly on Medicaid patients. The CCNC provides the education for those medicaid patients so they can keep up with their health in the proper way. Without the CCNC there would be a lack of education that has helped so may patients so far.

"I am a CNA working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with the most vulernable patients that have parents that are not capable of taking care of there children."

This waiver will limit our patients access to the current healthcare they receive. Please deny waiver.
I am not in support of the waiver due to the large impact it would cause on my community. I work in Robeson county and our office is 76% Medicaid patients. Denying access as we have been doing would harm the patients greatly. We have worked to treat them in the best way we can under Medicaid and changing things would not help in any way.
I am a pediatrician and strongly oppose this reform. It will be terrible for the children of North Carolina.

"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services.

"I practice in pediatrics in the rural county of Robeson County. Unfortunately we do not have access to local specialist unless it is at UNC, Duke, Or New Hanover. We have several high risk patients in the office. In fact, Duke Cardiologist once made a comment that he liked coming to Robeson County because he is able to see pathology in patients here that he does not see elsewhere. With this reform, we will be denying access for these critical patients to get the care that they need. PLEASE REJECT REFORM!"
I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care they deserve under NC Medicaid program.

Quality of care will be diminished if this waiver is passed. Healthcare is constantly in support of improving the quality of care and this would be a way that patients would not have the access to the care that has helped to treat them and diagnose them. Patients deserve the best care and this would provide a greater difficulty for them to be treated for complex and simple health concerns.
"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they desperately need. In fact, in my pediatric office , 3 out of 4 children receive Medicaid. Not only will it cause a burden on the office, it will cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits."

I am a CNA in NC and i am opposed to the waiver. the current system with CCNC has served NC pediatric medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationship that we have worked hard to build. having read the proposal and gone to a comment session i have found no pediatrician that think will be good for their patients or their practice.
"I am a Medical Office Assistant at a pediatrics office in Southeastern NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients I help everyday. Most of our patients receive help from the Medicaid system and a reform would likely mean that these patients will have an even larger hurdle to jump to receive the care they need.

As a citizen an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"As an NP serving children in a small rural community, I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes to Medicaid. I fear these changes will end in reduced access to both primary and specialty care as they will cause confusion and untold layers of bureaucracy.

"NC also desperately needs to expand Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands! Just by providing insurance for pregnant mothers alone, the state will save on the cost of future care for children by helping to prevent many illnesses & disabilities.

CMS oversight of & involvement w/ NC regarding its NC Reform proposal, etc. There are many troubling aspects in this waiver that NC has done little to address. Physicians & others in healthcare as well as individual citizens have voiced extreme concern with this waiver's dividing the state into regions of care that limit patient access to providers and utilize numerous LMOs, etc. that will create a billing nightmare for providers & patients alike. NC's Medicaid program is not broken. Why are they trying to ""fix"" it until it is? Most providers participate in NC Medicaid now, but under this new waiver, they likely will not. In addition, waivers & services for medically fragile children and people with disabilities (these waivers are included in the Medicaid Reform waiver) in the state are being butchered with little CMS accountability. NC failed to involve stakeholders & families in dialogue concerning major changes to the CAP waiver program that will significantly hurt these populations & their families. This is a CMS requirement, and NC flat out lied about it when submitting it to CMS. After being challenged by families, the state now plans to hold community meetings beginning next week, a work group, etc., but it does not change the fact that NC broke the law by not following CMS rules. Who knows how many other CMS rules NC has broken! CMS desperately needs to crack down on NC's DHHS (especially DMA) and hold them accountable for their responsibility to the citizens of NC. CMS has the authority to audit NC and even make site visits, etc. It is time that CMS do this to protect all of NC's citizens."

"As the Executive Director of the largest pediatric group in NC seeing over 78% Medicaid, I see how the proposed waiver can place the 150 hard-working employees' jobs in jeopardy. Since the loss of the ACA reimbursement 'bump' in 2013-14, we continue to struggle with cash flow issues. Primary care in the country accounts for approximately 3% of the total healthcare expenditures and primary care pediatrics most certainly much less. I feel that the privatization of Medicaid in the state will directly reduce reimbursement and definitely make it more challenging to fight for payment of services that are already rendered (considering that we will have up to 15 entities to deal with). I care tremendously for these 150 people and their families and would hate to see their jobs eliminated by an ill-conceived waiver."

"Require North Carolina to expand Medicaid and preserve Community Care of NC as conditions of Medicaid Reform. More than one-third of the 10 million North Carolinians live in low income, small rural towns or unincorporated areas where Medicaid is the largest insurer. Without Medicaid expansion to keep local hospitals open and providers engaged, NC DHHS will not be able to meet the goals of Medicaid reform. NC Medicaid eligible patients living in rural, low income areas will not have ""A Better Experience of Care"" because they will lack comprehensive services and an adequate number of providers. The communities where these same Medicaid eligible patients live will not have ""Better Health in Our Community."" Expanding Medicaid will provide the financial support necessary to keep open the safety net hospitals, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and free clinics that dot rural North Carolina.

Our home grown Community Care of North Carolina has kept 90% of our primary care providers engaged with the Medicaid population and with each other as they collaborate on improvements. That has kept our Medicaid population more healthy and it saved the State millions of dollars. Expanding Medicaid would maintain the physicians who live in these declining communities, support expansion and communication upgrades at our FQHCs and support communication and collaboration among the physicians. It would also increase the number of health care workers in low income areas and provide an economic boost to declining towns.

Expanding Medicaid also supports cost containment and funding predictability. Medicaid expansion states have reduced costs for uncompensated care and improving heath with reduced cost among the newly insured. There is no downside to expanding Medicaid. There is no reason to dismantle or essentially change our successful Community Care of North Carolina."

"CMS: Please do not contribute to the destruction of Pediatric Healthcare in North Carolina by approval of the NC 1115 Waiver. The fact that you have been given the task - by law - of ""Approval"" means that you can deny this! I realize that it is rare for CMS to ever deny a state's request, but it is rarer for a state to EVER ask for permission to destroy the best Medicaid system in the country ""just because they can"".
I am a pediatrician and went to one of the public comment sessions required prior waiver submission. No one spoke in favor of the waiver!. Afterwards I found the highest ranking state official - Deputy Secretary for Health Services, Randall Williams, MD and was speechless when he told me he thought pediatricians would be In Favor of the reform since it would make things ""better"". He practiced OB.GYN in Raleigh and as a physician did not accept Medicaid patients. He was personally clueless about our great program. The people who support and designed the waiver to fir the legislation have NO IDEA what they are doing!
They may mean well, but they did not bother to modify the waiver after 99% of all public COMMENTS were NEGATIVE. This is not about improving Medicaid - I t is about satisfying a handful of legislators! The Legislature did not ask for nor listen to those professionals providing care to the state's Medicaid population when they passed a law intended to pay back political favors and to destroy CCNC.
This waiver requests has nice sounding words that are meaningless. Do not be fooled. The sole purpose of this waiver is to destroy 30 years of incremental improvement in NC's Medicaid program. The legislation was proposed during a recession and during a period when NC DMA replaced the old computer system with a new one - there was no data to refute outrageous claims against the current program. We now have the data but the legislators driving this train were not interested in truth.
Please do your duty and deny this application or scale it back to ONLY ADULTS. SAVE NC PEDIATRIC MEDICAID! Keep our DMA office in charge of running our Medicaid program - they are doing a wonderful job and should not be replaced with For Profit companies like UHC! Please help us!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"
I propose all Medicaid recipients pay a mandatory co-pay for their visits.

"I have been a pediatrician in North Carolina for 22 years and actively daily provide excellent primary care to North Carolina's children regardless of whether or not they have Medicaid, private insurance, or are self pay. I am VERY concerned about the proposal to change the coverage and funding from what we currently have. I have witnessed CCNC from its development until now and am impressed at the personal, community based, physician led and driven advances in care we have already been able to make. I have NOT been impressed by anything that increases the complexity of care, the number of steps required to provide even simple prescriptions at times, the change to require approval of outpatient xray procedures some of which we have to actually argue with an approval person to get a procedure or xray done for our children. I am DISMAYED to think that we would have multiple agencies to contend with and that the patients themselves would be more responsible for navigating these different choices. They already have trouble with the current degree of flexibility. Let North Carolina continue our traditions of excellence in providing pediatric care WITHOUT the additional burdens proposed in this newest iteration of change of funding and coverage. Please do not approve this waiver."
Please extend the Medicaid coverage
I am a physician assistant in Robeson County. The proposed waiver would hurt my patients access to care. Please reject the waiver.
"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I cannot support a reform to Medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the citizens of North Carolina need."
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits.

"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."

Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. In a very poor rural area helping children with Medicaid is already increasingly difficult. A change to Medicaid is a negative change for North Carolina. I receive to support a reform that includes a Medicaid Wavier, because our patient's cannot receive the care they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program."
"I work for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina as a medical assistant and I do not support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now and I cannot imagine how much more complicated it would become for patients, providers, and billers having to deal with multiple entities. It makes since to stick with what works, even though we do have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than create more with a more complicated system. This would also impede our progress with getting patients with Medicaid the help they need from mental health providers."
"As a Registered Nurse in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need. I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid because it will not help NC's children receive the care they need!"
"As a PA in as office located SE NC that is part of larger corporation that sees 166,000 visits per year, 78% of which are Medicaid recipients, I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
"I am a medical assistant in Eastern NC who helps provide care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program."

"I am a receitionist_ at a pediatrics office in Southeastern NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients I help every day. Most of our patients receive help from the Medicaid system and a reform would likely mean that these patients will have an even larger hurdle to jump to receive the care they need. Reforming Medicaid not only makes me fear for my job in the pediatric health profession, but it also means that the people I care for have to fight that much harder to receive the care they need. As a citizen an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible.

As an employee of one of the largest pediatric practices in Southeastern NC this waiver could hinder a lot of children from receiving the medical care and medications they need. It could also force a lot of practices to stop seeing patients on Medicaid if not close their practices all together. Please stop this reform !!

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"
I work at a Pediatric office and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our medicaid program.
"I work at a pediatric office in NC as Medical Lab Tech, and i do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program.
I have worked in the Medical field for 28 years and I think this Medicaid Reform is absolutely wrong. We have people who cant afford any type of healthcare. Medicaid is the only health insurance that is available to them.
I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to to more expensive specialists. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC.
I am a Medical lab Technician working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system.
I work in a pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office 3 out of every 4 of our receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina.
The State of North Carolina's request, know as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina Medicaid population."

I am a nurse in NC and I oppose the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served NC medicaid patients well.

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. The children of Robeson County come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging from simple to complex. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.
"I work at a pediatric office in NC as a receptionist, and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program."
I work in pediatrics in Robeson County every day. In our office 3 out of every 4 patients receive Medicaid.

As a registration intake in the pediatric medical field I feel it imperative to voice my concerns for the Medicaid reform. I see first hand how children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare they need. the suggested reform including the waiver will make this process even harder. it is not fair to punish the children of nc by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care that they need. please consider removing the waiver to help nc children.

"I am 29 years old. I am in nursing school and cannot afford to quit my job due to obligations. This means I cannot afford the extra expense of health insurance. This puts ME at risk all because I am trying to better myself and my life. Medicaid would be very beneficial for me right now until I am done with school, and without it, I am left with nothing.

"I work in pediatrics and understand first-hand how this reform will NOT help the children of North Carolina. Years of hard work has helped create a system (CCNC) that is efficient and works! Is it perfect, no, but a complete overhaul will be a nightmare and end up costing tax payers of NC more money when the current system only needs tweaking. I'm afraid that a complete overhaul will not only hurt the people of North Carolina, it will also become a greater burden for them to get the healthcare they need."

I work at a Pediatric office and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our medicaid program.
I agree that Medicaid needs some changes. Maybe change that a child only can receive one physical per year instead of interperiodic where they can come in several times in one year. I think some of the changes that are being made is ridicilous
"Medicaid needs to be extended to meet the needs of more of North Carolina's uninsured. The uninsured use hospital EDs in ways that are very expensive to the hospitals, but also to the State as a whole. A healthy population is a productive (i.e. tax paying) population, but without insurance, such as Medicaid, North Carolina's working poor (which is the majority of the uninsured population) are not as productive as they might me."
"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary."
"Perfectly stated!!! ""CMS: Please do not contribute to the destruction of Pediatric Healthcare in North Carolina by approval of the NC 1115 Waiver. The fact that you have been given the task - by law - of ""Approval"" means that you can deny this! I realize that it is rare for CMS to ever deny a state's request, but it is rare for a state to EVER ask for permission to destroy the best Medicaid system in the country ""just because they can"".
I am a pediatrician and went to one of the public comment sessions required prior waiver submission. No one spoke in favor of the waiver!. Afterwards I found the highest ranking state official - Deputy Secretary for Health Services, Randall Williams, MD and was speechless when he told me he thought pediatricians would be In Favor of the reform since it would make things ""better"". He practiced OB.GYN in Raleigh and as a physician did not accept Medicaid patients. He was personally clueless about our great program. The people who support and designed the waiver to fir the legislation have NO IDEA what they are doing!
They may mean well, but they did not bother to modify the waiver after 99% of all public COMMENTS were NEGATIVE. This is not about improving Medicaid - I t is about satisfying a handful of legislators! The Legislature did not ask for nor listen to those professionals providing care to the state's Medicaid population when they passed a law intended to pay back political favors and to destroy CCNC.
This waiver requests has nice sounding words that are meaningless. Do not be fooled. The sole purpose of this waiver is to destroy 30 years of incremental improvement in NC's Medicaid program. The legislation was proposed during a recession and during a period when NC DMA replaced the old computer system with a new one - there was no data to refute outrageous claims against the current program. We now have the data but the legislators driving this train were not interested in truth.
Please do your duty and deny this application or scale it back to ONLY ADULTS. SAVE NC PEDIATRIC MEDICAID! Keep our DMA office in charge of running our Medicaid program - they are doing a wonderful job and should not be replaced with For Profit companies like UHC! Please help us!"""

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. The children in Robeson County and surrounding counties come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a more difficult time to receive the care that they deserve under NC Medicaid program.

please don't leave these adults out my boy friends disabled and doesn't work and need Medicaid because of a PE in his lung the one med cost 300 dollars and not to mention the doctors he has to see because of his disability now with this PE added on too it life has been made very had NC has to stand up for our poor and disabled and disadvantaged people otherwise how do we expect to stand period .
I am a nurse at a pediatric office in Robeson County one of the poorest in North Carolina. Our patients need us to support their well being in all aspects of life and to have quality life means they need us for medical care.
"As office manager in children's health in North Carolina, I see how reform to medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% population is medicaid. Our company operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor rural area, helping children with medicaid receive the care they need is already difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care they need. I can not support the proposed reform to medicaid because it will not help NC's children receive the care they need !!!"
"As an employee at a Children's Clinic, I feel it is imperative to voice my concerns for the Medicaid reform. I see, first-hand, how children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare they need. The suggested reform, including the waiver, will make this process even harder. It is not fair to punish the children of North Carolina by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care that they need. Please consider removing the waiver to help North Carolina's children!"
"Please deny this outrageous 1115 waiver request by NC!
The state legislature told our public that this ""reform"" was needed to control the budget over-runs of the state's Medicaid program. This is not true. The state went through a recession and purposefully ""low-balled"" the budget for Medicaid as a way to free up monies for other needed programs. Then they were ""shocked"" that the Medicaid program went over budget! Not a Medicaid spending problem, this was a BUDGETARY problem! There was also a recession and more people were signed up for Medicaid which is NOT a Medicaid spending problem - it was an economy problem! When the Governor took office, the top level management of Medicaid all got ""pink slips"" - with no job performance review. They were told that they could re-apply for their job. No surprise no one did! Nor is it a surprise when NC Medicaid went through some difficult times without leaders. And they changed computer systems. Either one of those issues is bad, but with both - it is amazing the employees left at DMA were able to hold this together! Our Per Member Per Month costs is 8% less than 5 years ago - CCNC is working and working well.

Exercise Judgment - DENY THIS WAIVER! Send it back to the legislature, and let they re-work something next year with a new group of legislators who value healthy children.
If you cannot out-right deny - at least exclude the 71% of the affected Medicaid Recipients who are Children -
>>Pediatric Medicaid Is Not Broken!<<

-Pediatrician who would like to continue serving ALL children!"

As a pediatric Physician Assistant, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
How can we provide care to these children if they are unable to come into the office because they can not afford to travel or pay a fee to see a provider.

"I am a pediatric nurse practitioner employed in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in North Carolina that serves a high Medicaid population. I oppose the new Medicaid proposal, because it will severely limit the healthcare that many of my Medicaid patients will receive. This will greatly impact special needs children, such as autistic, developmentally delayed, cerebral palsy, etc, because they require healthcare that I alone can not provide. Other care they need such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and seeing other pediatric specialists will be limited or not covered under Medicaid if this legislation passes. These children will greatly suffer, because these parents will not be able to afford these services out of pocket. Please reconsider this legislation for our children!"

"With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

I am a Physician Assistant in Robeson County. The waiver will be detrimental to our practice!

MEDICAID REFORM WILL KILL, ALOT OF OUR EDLERLY, THEY WERE THE ONES WHO HELP BUILD THIS COUNTRY."
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"

"I work for a pediatric practice in NC as a nurse. I do not support the switch from a single ""medicaid"" to 15 different entities.

"I work at a pediatric office in NC as a medical office assistant, and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program."
"I work in a Federally Qualified Health Center in North Carolina. Every day I work, I see the adverse health consequences of our state's refusal of enhanced Medicaid funding. My patients cannot afford medications or doctor visits, use the ER's for minor problems, and do not come for regular appointments. Despite ample medical and economic evidence that refusing Medicaid funds was a terrible mistake, our governing bodies have taken no remedial action. Our local hospitals are staggering under the weight of unreimbursed expenses, and the poor and the sick bear the overwhelming burden of this political mistake.
As to Medicaid reform, I feel that privatizing this vital service will have similar consequences to those of prison privatization--that corporate profits will outweigh actual care for those of our citizens who need it most. I find a continuing decrement in medical professional morale as professionals work harder with more meaningless measures of ""excellence"" with less and less time to spend with patients. There is no evidence that private corporate dictation of medical care will do anything but make things worse, by creating increased distance between those designing the state budget, and those receiving the care."
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina."
"I am office manager in Eastern NC at pediatric office who helps provide care for children, most of whom have medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver. It will ruin our successful medicaid and ccnc program !!"
"I believe that access to health care is a basic human right. When people are healthy, they are more viable and vibrant and can contribute to the economy. I think Medicaid should be expanded to those citizens who need the access."
"I am a receptionist working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not"
"I am the parent of a profoundly disabled 11 year old. Like many of her friends, she depends on the Medicaid waiver services. We depend on the staff coming into our home to help provide daily care for her. She is total care for all of her daily living needs.

Likewise, the additional funding available to us allow us to get equipment that insurance would otherwise not pay for that is essential for her safety and care, such as adaptive showering/toileting equipment, diapers or formula supplies. I am able to use waiver funding to get her an adaptive car seat to safely transport her around the community. Although my daughter is somewhat mobile, many friends require special vehicle adaptations such as a lift. Those modifications cost a lot of money, and are simply not something most families can afford and they depend on the waiver to assist them to made the changes.

I've also read that there are plans to cut NCHIPP. This subsidy pays us to keep primary insurance, so that medicaid is a secondary payer. Without this plan, we would likely eliminate private insurance for our daughter and the burden would go entirely to Medicaid, which would cost the state much more than simply paying for insurance premiums.

These programs are for those who need help the most."
Please expand Medicaid in North Carolina so people can receive the care that is needed.

I have worked in the Medical field for 28 years and I think this Medicaid Reform is absolutely wrong. We have people who cant afford any type of healthcare. Medicaid is the only health insurance that is available to them.
I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC.

Please do not contribute to the destruction of Pediatric Healthcare in North Carolina by approval of the NC 1115 Waiver. a lot of children in rural NC will not be able to go to doctors for the care they need.

"I am the receptionist at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in SE North Carolina. Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections. If this is accomplished under the waiver, the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices. It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."
I am opposed to reforming NC Medicaid as proposed.
Everyone has a right to healthcare -- EXPAND MEDICAID!!

"I CURRENTLY WORK FOR A PEDIATRIC PROVIDER IN SOUTHEASTERN NC. WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY CARE OF NC WE HAVE REDUCED ER VISITS, IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION, AND REDUCE COSTS BY MANAGING REFERRALS TO MORE EXPENSIVE SPECIALISTS. OUR CURRENT COLLABORATION WITH CCNC IS VERY EFFICIENT FOR PHYSICIANS, STAFF AND PATIENTS. COMPLETELY OVERHAULING A SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM SEEMS RIDICULIS. THEREFORE, I OPPOSE THE PROPOSED MEDICAID WAIVER FOR NC."
"I am a scheduler in Eastern NC who helps provide care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program."
We have so many patient that need our help please help them get Medicaid so they can get the services and the referral that they need. Medicaid is good for them have we here at the health center provide the best care that need but some need more. This would help them with dental and vision care.

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. The children of Robeson County come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging from simple to complex. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.

I feel it imperative to voice my concerns for the medicaid reform...I see children insured by medicaid struggle to get the healthcare they need. The suggested reform including the waiver will the process even harder !! It is unfair to punish the children of NC by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care that they need. Please consider removing the waiver to help NC children !!

As a tax payer and resident of North Carolina whom have never even used the Medicaid Program for assistance of any kind cannot support a reform.

I am a receiptionist in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver
"I currently work for a pediatric provider in southeastern n.c. working in coordination with community care of nc, we have reduced er visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more specialists. our current collaboration with ccnc is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid waiver for nc."

I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections.

It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."

"As a Nursing Assistant in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need.

"am a receptionist at a pediatrics office in Southeastern NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients I help every day.

As a citizen an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."

"As a Registered Nurse in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in North Carolina, my pediatric patients are dependent upon federal funding. Pediatric patients are considered one of the most vulnerable populations, because they are dependent upon someone else to receive the care they need. Although, some of the proposed changes are needed to help continue with future funding for others, the pediatric patients can not suffer in the process."
I am a nurse in a pediatric office in which has a large number of Medicaid patient and we already have reduced payments from the present program. The changes that the reform would bring would effect jobs and the effect of that would therefore effect our own family and health care.

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. The children of Robeson County come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging from simple to complex. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.

"I work for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina and I do not support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now and I cannot imagine how much more complicated it would become for patients, providers, and billers having to deal with multiple entities. It makes since to stick with what works, even though we do have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than create more with a more complicated system. This would also impede our progress with getting patients with Medicaid the help they need from mental health providers"
"I am in support of Medicaid. It is needed in the state of NC. We have so many underserved and underprivileged people dying right now because of lack of healthcare. It may not be you today, but it very well could be you tomorrow.

"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need.

I am a Nursing Assistant in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver
"Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC."

"Medicaid expansion is a MUST!!!! We have too many working citizens and children falling in the ""GAP"" of not being covered for basic medical care. Unfortunately many businesses cut hours so that they don't have to provide insurance to our citizens. Not only does this hurt the employee but their family/children as well. WAKE UP NC!!!!!"

"As a Registered Nurse in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need. I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid because it will not help NC's children receive the care they need!"
"I am the Nursing Assistant at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in SE North Carolina. Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections. If this is accomplished under the waiver, the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices. It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."
"Dear Senators & Representatives,
I would like to strongly encourage you to vote to expand Medicaid to include those with the lowest incomes in our state. I have worked at community health centers for over 20 years as a family physician and see the need for this expansion on a daily basis. We can take care of primary care issues but the patients then have a very limited ability to access imaging studies and specialty care when needed and many medications are out of reach for them. Please vote to expand Medicaid to help our most vulnerable patients to receive the care they need.

Thank you for your consideration,
Cynthia J. Witt, M.D."

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson co.. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio.

I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.

"Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through medicaid, I can see how this reform will continue to make things harder for them. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The addition of separate regions, PHP's and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advance care, the medicaid waiver process would make that virtually impossible. I refuse to support the proposed reform."

A reformed program would not give us quality improvement . I do not support the reform of our present Medicaid program.
"I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous.

I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio.

I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.

"As a Interpreter in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need.

"The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible.

"I currently work as a Nursing Assistant for a Pediatric Clinic. I work 40+ hours every week and I have two children whom are covered by Medicaid. I am so thankful for Medicaid. Without Medicaid my children would not receive the care or medicine that they need on a daily basis because as a full-time employee I would not be able to afford it. Not only does Medicaid help cover office/hospital expenses it also covers my children's prescriptions that they take on a daily basis. Both my children are asthmatic so they require follow-up appointments and medication refills that Medicaid helps cover. My oldest son has been diagnosed with 'Migraines' so he see's a specialist which again, Medicaid covers. So, not only is Medicaid very much needed for other children and families but also for mine, a hard full-time working Mother who just wants to be able to provide and care for her children.

The current system with CCNC has served NC pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver.
"I work at a Children's Clinic and the majority of our patients have Medicaid. If this waiver is passed it will be very detrimental to our organization. Also, if this waiver is passed we wouldn't have the majority of our patients and we could possibly have a lay off which would be hurting a lot of families living conditions"

"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I cannot support a reform to Medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the citizens of North Carolina need."
Health service such as telehealth will not be a positive step in pediatric health care.

"As a registered voter, and resident of North Carolina, I am asking our federal government to forcefully request, if not legislate, that the state of North Carolina extend Medicaid coverage to the uninsured.

North Carolina, statistics reveal about 244,000 adults are stuck in the 'coverage gap,' with no good way to get health insurance.
Most of these people are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace.

Is the Federal Government aware that a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid?

I'm aware the federal government is currently considering whether or not to approve changes to NC's Medicaid program. Unfortunately, our state officials haven't proposed closing the coverage gap by extending Medicaid to low-income adults. How can North Carolina state and federal lawmakers sleep at night knowing that our government continues to leave these individuals out?

244,000 mothers, fathers, children, aunts, uncles, and other family members are without appropriate access to health care. You have the power to affect the quality of life of 244,000 North Carolina residents, human beings, and people who pay taxes! We voted you into office and we can vote you out!

"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
The medicaid waiver in the reform plan does not seem to be feasible. As an employee of a pediatric office that consists of 76% of medicaid patients I see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. I cannot support a reform to medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the children of North Carolina need.
"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I cannot support a reform to Medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the citizens of North Carolina need."
"As a lab tech in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. In addition, the company for which I am employed operates in 4 different offices in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need is already increasingly difficult. With the addition of these proposed changes, it will be even harder for these children to receive the care their need. I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid because it will not help NC's children receive the care they need!"

"The State of North Carolina's request , know as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care , and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population."

I work in pediatrics everyday. I check patients in and out everyday. Over 76% of our patients receive help from Medicaid assistance. As an employee and as a mother I really hope for kids you reject this wavier.

"As an Interpreter in a Pediatric Clinic, I would like to express my opinion or concerns for the Medicaid reform. I see how parents of children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare that their children need.

The suggested reform, including the waiver, will make this process even harder, and I do not think it is fair to punish North Carolina children because of the many more hurdles their parents must cross in order to receive the care their children need.
Please remove the waiver to help the Children of North Carolina!"

"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.

With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.

Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"

"The North Carolina 1115 Demonstration Waiver falls short in a significant way: it fails to expand Medicaid coverage to an estimated 500,000 hardworking, North Carolinians. From a public health perspective the implications of this decision are enormous. Study after study demonstrates that the uninsured experience sicker lives and poor health than others. Medicaid enrollees have access to far greater health care services than their uninsured counterparts.

North Carolina's Medicaid program currently does not cover parents whose incomes are greater than 50 percent of the federal poverty level (about $10,000 for a family of three) and adults without children who are not elderly or disabled have no coverage at all. The state's Medicaid eligibility levels rank in the bottom quartile of the states. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, North Carolina's uninsured rate is 15.6 percent, exceeding the national average of 10.5 percent. It will be hard for North Carolina to achieve the aim of better health in our state if 500,000 of our neighbors have no coverage."

"As a registered voter, and resident of North Carolina, I am asking our federal government to forcefully request, if not legislate, that the state of North Carolina extend Medicaid coverage to the uninsured.

North Carolina, statistics reveal about 244,000 adults are stuck in the 'coverage gap,' with no good way to get health insurance.
Most of these people are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace.

Is the Federal Government aware that a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid?

I'm aware the federal government is currently considering whether or not to approve changes to NC's Medicaid program. Unfortunately, our state officials haven't proposed closing the coverage gap by extending Medicaid to low-income adults. How can North Carolina state and federal lawmakers sleep at night knowing that our government continues to leave these individuals out?

244,000 mothers, fathers, children, aunts, uncles, and other family members are without appropriate access to health care. You have the power to affect the quality of life of 244,000 North Carolina residents, human beings, and people who pay taxes! We voted you into office and we can vote you out!

The issues we experience now are so complicated I know we would never resolve issues with the new reform. This system appears to be a more complicated and would slow the process.
"The NC plan to reform Medicaid should include closing the coverage gap. Health care access and equity should be the cornerstones of any reform plan. Most in the gap (over 60%) are working, but at jobs without benefits (like construction, child care, retail, fast food, contract/freelance or self-employed work) or they work several part-time jobs and can't qualify for benefits or they are working parttime and studying parttime (for a better job or a degree) and don't have health insurance. Others stay at home and take care of sick or disabled relatives. Health equity is critical. Medical care should not be a privilege just for those who can afford it; it should be a basic right. Not only does it make sense from a humanitarian point of view, but economically, as well.

I do not support the Medicaid reform. I work in a pediatric office and we treat many children with health problems that have to be referred out.

"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on North Carolina's Medicaid Reform 1115 Demonstration. North Carolina has proposed a major change to the delivery of Medicaid in our state. One of the goals of the waiver is to connect children and families to better health. We urge North Carolina's leaders to expand Medicaid eligibility as permitted by the Affordable Care Act, thus providing essential health care access to more than 300,000 individuals in our state who currently have no other options available to them. They do not fall into an eligible category for Medicaid and they earn too little to qualify for financial assistance in the Health Insurance. I strongly oppose this waiver."

"I own a small DME providing mainly incontinence and enteral supplies and equipment. My customers can choose whatever brand of diaper that works best for them, even if I end up making very little profit. It's important to me that my customers are satisfied, that they enjoy good skin integrity and dry clothes during the night.

My concern with Medicaid managed care is that the ACOs will do what other states with Medicaid managed care have done: give all the business to the single lowest bidder (a national distributor or manufacturer). My customers will get stuck with ""cheap Medicaid diapers,"" the lowest cost feeding pumps and supplies, and all of the local North Carolina-based DME companies will go out of business. Our customers will no longer have a choice.

The reform plan must allow continued competition among DME companies so that patients continue to have a choice of providers throughout the state."
I currently wore in pediatrics in Robeson county. the inclusion of Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. the children of Robeson county come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging form simple to complex.

As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I cannot support a reform to Medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the citizens of North Carolina need."
Managed care is not a good ideal for Medicaid in the Pediatric field
"North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Wavier with working in healthcare makes me fear for my job & the jobs of my fellow co-workers. Most importantly, the patients that we care for will struggle more to receive the care that is needed. As an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid wavier."
As a Employee of a Pediatric office and as a Mother this concerns me very much. I strongly disagree with this waiver. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by legislators and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program.
"I do not see how the proposed changed will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system, that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. the proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
"I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous.

"The State of North Carolina's request, known as a Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population."

I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid because it will not help North Carolina's children receive the care they need.
"My step daughter recently had a baby. She works for a daycare in Raleigh that doesn't pay her much. She currently only has one income to help support her child and without Medicaid, she would not have been able to afford a nice hospital like Duke. I believe that without Medicaid it would have been a stressful pregnancy for her not only effecting her mental and physical health, but also the baby. Please expand Medicaid, as it helps a lot of people who are already trying to help themselves, but just can't afford to do so without Medicaid.

Also, North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.

Thank you for your consideration!"

"I am the registration intake at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in se north Carolina. our coporation is 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerened about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different phps as well as breaking the state into sections. if this is accomplished under the waiver, the adminsistrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices. it will be extremely difficult and time consuming to practices to dispute claim,affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that cms will not approve it."
I am a Lab Technician in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC ha s served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read the proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the wavier.
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina."
"PLEASE save our Pediatricians and our kids by NOT passing the NC governors proposal for Medicaid reform!
Thanks for listening to us!"
"It is my opinion as a Director of Compliance in Pediatrics that it is imperative to voice many concerns for the Medicaid reform. The children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare that is needed. With the suggested reform, including the waiver, this will make the process even harder for them. More children will end up in the hospital because they did not get the basic care needed and in return were sicker which requires hospitalization. To punish our children of North Carolina is extremely unfair by making them jump thru hurdles to receive care. If this happens to our children when they grow up to be adults it will only get worse. Your consideration to remove the waiver will not only help the children of North Carolina but all citizens."
CCNC has made healthcare for Robeson County very effective to provide care for our children.

Independent Pediatric Practice Manager post - For years we've heard that the real expense for NC Medicaid is the adult population. Why not separate those out and leave the pediatric population under the current plan. We've saved you money for years. CCNC has saved you money for years....Your pediatric patients today will effect your adult population eventually. Take care of them today!

Expansion of Medicaid to close the gaps in North Carolina's coverage is the only way to address the glaring health needs of the State's low-income populations. NC Government's waiver application does not address the critical access issues faced by many in the state who make too little for ACA coverage and don't qualify for Medicaid. NC should not be allowed to privatize its Medicaid program without expansion of coverage.
I am an employee at a pediatric office in NC. We provide care for children with Medicaid. I urge you to reject this wavier that is put forth by NC Legislators.
I am a manager at a Pediatric office. I am against the waiver. I see patients that come in our office that truly need their services. The parents in our county cannot afford to pay for the services out of pocket.
Access to medical care will decrease with Medicaid reform . Our children as well as our adults will suffer with the reform. Who can afford this . I do not support this reformed program. CCNC should not change.
"AS A MEDICAL OFFICE ASSITANT IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH IN NORTH CAROLINA, I SEE HOW A REFORM TO MEDICAID WILL BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE. I WORK IN AN OFFICE IN WHICH 76% OF OUR PATIENTS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM MEDICAID. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I AM EMPLOYED OPERATES IN 4 DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WITH PROPSED CHANGES, SOME OF OUR OFFICES MAY END UP IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. IN A VERY POOR, RURAL AREA, HELPING CHILDREN WITH MEDICAID RECEIVE TGHE CARE THEY NEED IS ALREADY INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. WITH THE ADDITIONOF THESE PROPOSED CHANGES. IT WILL BE EVEN HARDER OF THESE CHLDREN TO RECEIVED THE CARE THEIR NEED. I CANNOT SUPPORT THE PROPOSED REFORM TO MEDICAID BECAUSE IT WILL NOT HELP NC""S CHILDREN RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED!"
I feel that completely changing this system will cause hardship for several of our Patients.
I support CCNC my children receive services from this program. They both have asthma that is managed by CCNC. Without this program I don't know what I would have done.
There are so many kids that need care and without Medicaid benefits they will not receive this care. Some of these kids have special needs that parents can't afford without help. Please don't forget our young ones.
I support CCNC my children receive services from this program. They both have asthma that is managed by CCNC. Without this program I don't know what I would have done.
"I strongly oppose this reform, children and healthcare givers in Southeastern NC will be significantly affected by this change."
"HE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA'S REQUEST KNOW AS SECTION 1115 EMONSTRATION WAIVER, WOULD REPLACE TH AWARD WINNING COMMUNITY CARE OF NORTH CAROLINA PROGRAM WITH COMPLED AND UNPROVEN MODEL THAT COULD DISRUPT ESTABLISHED PROVIDER NETWORKS, DIMINISH ACCESS TO CARE, AND DEGRADE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR NORTH CAROLINA'S MEDICAID POPULATION."

As a employee of a pediatric practice in NC this reform will hurt the healthcare community and affect the care given to patients whom have Medicaid as the only form of insurance coverage for their care. I oppose this waiver.
Our Medicaid Program has provided assistance to our families in medical need for sometime now and has worked well for children with special needs such as ADD and Asthma . What will happen to a child with Asthma attack in full flare whom has to travel 50 miles to get help. Will this child suffer more because of change in access to medical help. Yes and maybe even die . I do not support reformed program.
The children of NC. need your help on this Medicaid Waiver. It saddens me to know that these children will suffer for things that are not their fault. Don't punish the kids for adult problems.
I support job security not Medicaid reform.
I currently work in a pediatric office in southNC. With our company working with CCNC and collaborating with them it is efficent for doctors and providers to provide successful care andoesn't make good since to over haul a system. medicaid is needed and it doesn't need to be cut out.
"I currently work in pediatrics in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio. The children of Robeson County come to our practice, because they know they will receive the upmost quality care for issues ranging from simple to complicated. I refuse to support such a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver, because this means our patients as well as our clinic will have a difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program."
I work at a pediatric office in NC as a RN. I have been a nurse for over 18 years and have seen many changes in healthcare but I do not support this change. I am asking not only as a healthcare worker but as a concerned citizen of NC that you deny this waiver and save our state's Medicaid program.
"I work in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in the state. We have a high rate of kids in foster care. Who have been abandon by their parents. Without parents to take care of them ,Who will do it? Someone has to take care of their medical needs. Without medicaid the high risk kids that have heart problems. Who will take care of those kids? Theses are the issues that the waiver will affect."
I currently am employed by a pediatric office in Robeson County and I see that the medicaid reform will greatly impact the children and families if this was to implemented. If you have to work in the pediatric office you see first hand how much the children need for things to be better and not worse. The only ones that suffers is the children. So for the children I cannot support the proposed medicaid waiver.
I work at a pediatric clinic in Robeson county and I feel that they should leave medcaid alone. a lot of our parents don't have jobs that they really can afford to take out the insurance that maybe the company they work for provides. Have you guys even gave that a thought?
I work in a medical office and see patients that are directly affected by Medicaid every day. A reform that does not put the needs of our patients first is not a reform that I can support.
"I don't agree with the changes that are being proposed about medcaid. our children need to be taken care of health wise. This change would affect a lot of families that depend on medcaid and also our pediatrics,hospitals,dental care..."
I am a Receptionist at a North Carolina Pediatric office. This waiver will complex the care of our patients and our Employment.
Please do not approve the waiver that Governor McCrory's has brought forth to change Medicaid as it stands today. This reform could hurt the healthcare community.And people will not be able to doctor for care they need. I strongly oppose this reform !

The medicaid reform waiver would do the state a dis justice if it was to do away with CCNC. The impact at our large rural pediatrics clinic is detrimental. We need them to assist us to properly manage our chronic illness patients. Please rethink this waiver and expand Medicaid as well.
Reimbursement with our current Medicaid program is slow and the payments are less. If this reform takes place the delivery system will only become worse showing no reason for change in the system .
"I work for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina as a Medical Office Assistant, and I do not support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to fifteen different entities. I see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now, and I can only imagine how complicated things would become for patients, providers, and billers having to deal with multiple entities. It makes great sense to continue doing what works best for our state of poverty."
"What would be the point of PCMH, patient centered medical home, if there is passed? You would be taking the center off the patient and giving to the state. Why would you want to create an unfair system for medicaid patients to receive the proper quality of care that they truly deserve."
"I am a nursing assistant in Eastern NC. who helps provide for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC. legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program. Our patients are very deserving of everything they get."
"Medicaid reform, especially when it includes the changes as proposed by Governor McCrory, will do nothing for the state of North Carolina other than hurt those who are currently in the program. Advancements made with CCNC have made great strides over the years in the Medicaid program and to change it would be devastating to those in the program. I sincerely hope that the politicians involved will take a second look at how these changes will negatively effect those who participate in the program. Sectioning off the state may terminate care by specialists who travel to rural areas. I do not support a reform that does not put the needs of those in the Medicaid program first."
"I worked in GA as an PNP for 10 yrs with statewide managed care. It is difficult as a provider to work with all the different plans. All the plans have different formularies and rules so you had to practice medicine based on what plan the patient has. Some children needed a certain drug but their plan did not cover it, but another one did, so you were constantly having them change plans just so they could get the meds they needed. This takes time so the patient may not have the med they need for a month or more until the plan can be changed. Every time you turn around you had to get a PA for something due to limited coverage. This just takes more time, money and people to get the patient what they need. The patient and provider suffer because providers cannot just see the patient, order a med or test without having another step and "" approval by the company"" to provide what the patient needs. It is so much more efficient to have one Medicaid so all patients have the same coverage for all their needs. There are no extra steps and providers do not have to jump through hoops with all the different plans to get what they need. It delays care for the patient and limits their benefits. Please do not pass this plan. It is just a headache for everyone and does not help patients or providers.
Thanks, PNP in Eastern NC."
"The waiver is not good for the children of NC. Increased MCOs up to 15 allowed in waiver, increased complexity, rules, decreased participation by PCPs and Specialist networks, uncertain reimbursement including possible capitation that will be determined by for-profit entities based on shareholder interests. Loss of CCNC a nationally recognized entity with proven quality and cost containment success. Loss of an efficient Medicaid system, noting that with reimbursements less than ½ of private insurers, the only way pediatricians can continue to see Medicaid patients is with an efficient Medicaid system and the waiver will destroy efficiency causing pediatricians to stop taking Medicaid. This will reduce access to quality care for children, our most vulnerable population. Include any personal stories, if you have them, on how the similar experiment of mental health reform/privatization has not worked in NC, especially with children. Remind them you are a tax payer and this is a waste of tax payer money and the legislature failed to listen to the overwhelming public comment against the waiver before sending it on to CMS- a political process failure for NC."
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In NC, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; currently at least 244,000 of those are in the Coverage Gap and are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in NC were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In NC, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics can't get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression aren't getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in NC could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers enabling them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Expanding North Carolina's Medicaid program would be a most important change for our state's health. We take care of our children through Medicaid benefits, but if their care-givers, parents or other family members don't have access or can't afford access to health insurance, how can those people take care of their children properly? If you don't have your health, what quality of life is that for any of us? We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid! Kathy Hudson, Gaston County, NC"
"As an administrator at the largest pediatric corporation in the state, I believe this would detrimentally affect the way our Medicaid patients have access to care. The fact that we have 4 offices that are located in different counties could mean that our patients would not have access to our after hours clinic in one county. This would also mess the system up even more than what it currently is based on its method to reassign patients and dealing with the new 15 different entities for billing."
"This waiver would decrease access to care for specialty clinics due to lower reimbursement to providers. You will see more and more specialty doctors refusing to see Medicaid patients, which is not fair. What will these patients do???"
"I am a Medical Office Assistant in North Carolina and I'm opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for the patients of their practice. Please say no to the waiver for the sake of the children of North Carolina, and the hard working people of the pediatric medical field."
"This waiver would more than likely reduce reimbursement to providers which directly affects the patients. There is already a shortage in primary care physicians, this would just add fuel to the fire and cause an even bigger gap in physician shortages."
This waiver would create a complicated delivery system for all offices. You would have an administrative uproar due to have to deal with 15 different managed care companies. This would create more work and stress on employees.
I work In a pediatric office in North Carolina and I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 entities. I feel that this would do the children a great disservice.
As a mother that depends on Medicaid to provide for my children I cannot support this change. It will only makes things more difficult for my children to recieve the medical care that they need. Please save the medicaid program.

"This waiver would create a complicated delivery system for patients. In a county like ours, that is rural and very low income, there is huge education gap among our patients. Our patients would need appropriate resources and education provided to understand these new changes and how they are assigned. This is manpower that we do not currently have and would need to have in place for our patients."
I do not see how the proposed changes will help children obtain the care they need. The proposed changes to the Medicaid program will make things more difficult. I refuse to support the proposed reform.
I feel that changes to the present Medicaid program this will not be helpful to patients.
"I have worked as a nurse in a pediatric office for the past 7 years, and I DO NOT support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities.

"This waiver would dramatically affect the way in which we provide care. If switching to capitation, we would want our patients to never come in the office as opposed to coming in when needed. This would really affect the quality of care provided and not allow us as pediatrics to provide the preventative care that is truly needed."
"I WORK AS A NURSE IN A PEDIATRIC OFFICE IN SOUTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA, I DO NOT SUPPORT THE MEDICAID WAIVER."
I don't understand the Medicaid reform.
"I feel strongly to voice my opinion on Governor McCrory's proposal for Medicaid reform. I am very concerned that children and the elderly adults and those who have true disabilities will be affected in a terrible way and will no longer be able to seek healthcare or get the medications that need. Yes, I agree there are changes that could be made like people that are very capable of working should have to get a ""JOB"", and not try to beat the system. Medicaid should require that people who get assistance show proof of employment unless disabled. People don't draw unemployment without stipulations. I strongly oppose this reform."
"Health should not be a partisan issue, but the sad fact is that the Republican leadership in Raleigh prefers to let a significant number of North Carolinians suffer and die rather than expand Medicaid. I don't think this is about dollars, as they claim, or even about the ideology of small government. It is motivated by racism: to expand Medicaid might be perceived as a policy victory for our Black President. This is shameful and reprehensible."
I don't understand the whole thing
Job security!!!! Lack of reimbursement will not only affect providers but our ancillary staff that is needed to run the practice. There will be a lack of funds to pay our administrative staff that are vital to running a practice. This waiver is making people wonder if they will even have a job in 18 months to 3 years.
ai don't agree with the whole thing
"I work at a pediatric office as the Director of Quality Improvement, and I DO NOT SUPPORT this waiver. Please deny this waiver and save our MEDICAID PROGRAM!!!!"
I work in a pediatrics office in NC as a nurse. I do not agree with the reform of medicaid to 15 different entities or the loss of CC4C.
I THINK IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST TO NOT PASS THIS WAIVER. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE MEDICAID AND ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE. THIS WOULD BE A VERY BAD DECISION TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THIS CHOICE.
"What really bothers me is the waste that no one seems to be controlling. It's on ebay, amazon, facebook - people giving away or selling medical supplies because they have ""overstock."" That is a waste of my tax dollars and an example of why patients need more intensive case management, not less.

If case management is considered an admin overhead, it will not be provided to the extent it's needed to prevent waste and abuse."
I work in a pediatric office in Robeson County. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic with a high Medicaid patient ratio.
THE PEDIATRIC OFFICE I WORK IN PROVIDES CARE TO MOSTLY MEDICAID RECIPIENTS. THIS WAIVER WOULD ONLY HURT OUR PRACTICE AND PUT MY JOB IN JEOPARDY. BUT MOST OF ALL OUR CHILDREN WOULD SUFFER.
I think telemedicine is a great idea. Working with school system to ensure proper care while the student is in school.
"I am providing comment on behalf of the 9,500 uninsured individuals seeking care through our community health center. Since the implementation of the ACA, we have thankfully seen a slight decrease in the number of uninsured adults seeking healthcare services; yet, over 9,500 people came to us last year totally devoid of any type of healthcare coverage. These are people falling into the gap created when the State of North Carolina chose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion. I am expressing my concern from only one eastern North Carolina community health center network; the situation is replicated across the State. Residents of many of our rural counties across the State are living in abject poverty. Adjacent to one of our health center sites is a 'soup kitchen' where I watch crowds of people standing in line every single day for a meal; old people, young people, some with canes and walkers...standing in 95 degree heat for food. Within our own patient population, 75% live at or below 100% of the FPL; that equates to 11,700 people. It seems the very least we can do is open access to healthcare services through Medicaid expansion so that our residents do not have to choose between seeking healthcare services and feeding their family. There are a lot of problems in our State and across the Country these days...problems that don't have solutions. This problem HAS a solution. We need to make it happen."
Insurance alone is too expensive for anyone to afford much less those who are unable to work. Medicaid is the only way people can get the treatment they need and require.
"I work as a Registered Nurse in a pediatric office in Southeaster





I work as a registered nurse in a pediatric practice in southeaster NC. This waiver will be detrimental to our patents and our practice and my employment."
Very bad decision for this to be passed.
With this waiver our patients will not have access to specialty care. Will this mean our death toll will rise? Our critically ill patients will not be able to see neurology and cardiology. I am opposed of the waiver.
Medicaid gap coverage needs to be provided in North Carolina. Too many people are not covered and are not receiving the healthcare they need and deserve.
I work In NC. in a pediatric office and I feel no child should be turned away for lack of funds. That is exactly what is happening here because of this Medicaid Waiver.
I am a Pediatrician in southeastern NC. Most of our patients receive Medicaid and I am afraid it will affect how we can give care and whether we can stay viable. I fear for my job in this health care environment. I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver.
"As an employee in a pediatric office I feel that it is my duty to voice my opinion on the Medicaid reform. In our county we are 75% Medicaid. I feel that reform will alter the quality of care that our patients receive. The children and their health is my greatest concern, if they can't get the services that they need then its them that suffer. We see a lot of children with complicated health conditions in no way do I want them to not be able to get the treatment that they need. I hope that you will consider removing the waiver so that our children won't have to pay the consequences."
"I am a Registered Nurse at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in Southeaster NC. Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. If this waiver is approved, the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for our practices and affect our cash flow to a great extent."
I do not support the Medicaid reform.
"The administration of this program must put the client first to ensure a seamless and standardized transition. Children must continue to receive quality health care provided by their medical home, inclusive of a case manager that is intimately connected to that practice."
I work at a pediatric office in N.C. as a FNP and do not approve this change. Please deny this waiver.
I work at a pediatric office in N.C. as a FNP and do not approve this change. Please deny this waiver.
"I work in an office in southeastern NC as a PA, please deny the waiver in efforts to maintain the medicaid program."
"I work as a Registered Nurse in a pediatric office in Southeastern NC. As a citizen and an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
I urge policymakers to follow the facts and use not just their heads but also their hearts to help those who need it the most.
Community Care of NC has proven to be a great asset in the clinic I work in. Community care has worked to reduce ER visits especially for asthma patients. This has decreased cost for these patients. We are making efforts to reduce overall healthcare cost. I do not support the Medicaid waiver.
"As a FNP in the pediatric medical field, I feel it imperative to voice my concerns for the medicaid reform. The suggested reform, including the waiver, will make the process even harder. Please consider removing the waiver to help NC's children."
"As the world is faced with so many changes everyday, making a change to the current medicaid program that would affect the health care needs of so many would only add to the catastrophe that we are already facing daily. Many people depend on Medicaid to help provide insurance for themselves and their family and to put such a reform in place would only make things worse. Please save our MEDICAID program....."
"The proposed medicaid reform will create problems that will deny north Carolinian's access to medical care, especially in high poverty areas in which I practice as a PA. This interference to healthcare access will likely result in more ER visits. Please deny the medicaid reform."
Please consider removing this waiver to help NC children who receive Medicaid benefits. This will not only affect patient care bur also be detrimental to our employees and job security.
"Being part of the medical community I have seen the good, the bad and ugly that comes with Medicaid. The premises of Medicaid started out with good intentions, but like everything else, what once started out as good intentions has become damaged over the years. Yes there need to be some kind of reform to Medicaid, but what NC is proposing is going to be detrimental to people who really need it. With that being said, I do not support the Medicaid Reform."
"Please find our public comments regarding North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Proposal attached.

Sincerely,

Michelle Hughes, NC Child"
"I am a Medical Interpretor at a pediatrics office in Southeastern NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients I help every day. I'm very scared that this my affect my job.I don't support the proposed Medicaid waiver. I work in the Health Field and I don't support this changes.Their is really a lot off people that don't need the Medicaid and get it and those that really needed can't get it."
"I think the Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform is not feasible. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in the ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I do not support Medicaid reform because it ignores so many vital components that the citizens of NC need."
Please consider declining the waiver that is in place to reform the medicaid program. I am a PA in a pediatric office. This reform will result in huge numbers of children living in poverty having no access to the healthcare they need. The children with major medical problems could suffer more or even suffer furthur decline in their health due to lack of access to healthcare.
"I work in a Pediatrics office in N.C. my thoughts concerning the reform is the laws in the State of NC need to change. The department of Social Services hands are tied. So with so much talk about cuts, lets start with persons that are able to work but don't. Lets care for our CHILDREN!!!!"
"I am a LPN at a pediatrics office in the Southeastern NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect the families and patients am in contact with everyday, and help daily. More than 75% of our patients receive help from the Medicaid system and the reform would hurt this families who are trying receive care they need. This reform on medicaid not only makes me fear for my job in the pediatric health profession, but it also means that the people I care for have ti fight that much harder to receive that care they need. As a citizen an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"As a FNP in the pediatric medical field, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. In the office in which I work, 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. We operate in 4 different offices in different counties. In a very poor, rural area, helping children with Medicaid receive the care they need in already increasingly difficult. With the addition of the proposed changes, it will be even harder for them to get the care they need."
"As a mid level provider, I have noticed it has become increasingly difficult to provide patient's with the care they need. The new medicaid reform will make it even harder to gain access to care for our patients. I do not support the considered medicaid reform."
"I work at ta pediatric office in NC as a LPN, and I do not support this change. Please Deny this wavier and save our Medicaid Program."
"The state of N.C.'s request, known as a section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning community care of NC (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for NC's Medicaid population."
As a Pediatrician in children's health in NC. I see how reform to Medicaid would be a administrative nightmare. Our office sees 76% Medicaid. We have 4 different clinics in our private corporations. It is possible with the proposed changes that some of our clinics will be in different regions. That would disastrous for our practices. I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid because it will not help the NC children that need the most help.
I work in SE North Carolina our Medicaid system is not perfect but I urge our legislators to reject the waiver and keep our current Program with NC Medicaid and CCNC.
I can't see where this Medicaid reform wavier can help our children. If it passes I don't think our children will get the care they need. Please reconsider this wavier.
"The benefits of CCNC (Community Care in NC) have proven to be great in the patient population I serve as a PA. The employees of CCNC are very involved in patient care in the pediatric office I work in. I do not support the medicaid reform because CCNC will be replaced by a system that is unproven and would put our children at risk of insuffecient healthcare. Our children that have chronic disease would suffer greatly. For this reason, I do not support the medicaid reform."
"I work in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in the state of North Carolina as Medicaid billing clerk. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care our patients deserve. Pediatricians deal with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand at all how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the complete system and the children will be the victims of a failed system. The reform jeopardizes the well being of all children that are enrolled with Medicaid and the children they come in contact with at daycare and school."
I am a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver
"I am a FNP working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system."
"As a Physician Assistant working in Southeastern NC in a pediatric office I feel the medicaid reform would result in children not receiving the care they need. In addition, the strain on the administration would result in decreased efficiency in medical clinics and the care of these patients. Please deny the medicaid reform."
"I work at a pediatric office in NC as a PA, and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program."
"I see firsthand the difficulties pediatric Medicaid patients face in receiving healthcare. Medicaid already chooses what medicines, services, etc. that they will cover, and this new legislation may further limit what our patients can receive. I work at a pediatric clinic in rural southeastern North Carolina, where majority of our patients receive Medicaid insurance. I oppose this new legislation, because it will further increase the difficulties our patients face receiving the appropriate healthcare they deserve. Providing quality healthcare can not continue if NC Medicaid further decreases their coverage for patients as well as their reimbursements to healthcare providers."
I am a PA working in a pediatric office in SE NC and am opposed to the Medicaid waiver. Our patients have a difficult time navigating the current system and the waiver will just make the process much more complicated.
Please reconsider this reform a lot of people will be negatively affected by this waiver. I oppose the reform.

"I am a physician assistant working in Robeson County, a county in which most of the popoulation lives in poverty. The waiver will decrease the access to care for many citizens of our county. I do not support the medicaid waiver."
"I am the FNP at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in SE North Carolina. Our corporation in 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHP's as well as breaking the state into sections. If this is accomplished under the waiver, the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices. It will be extremely difficult and time consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver an hope that CMS will not approve it."

I work in a pediatric office as a provider where at least 70% of our patients have Medicaid. Changes in the Medicaid program would adversely effect the care that our patients receive. Please reconsider any changes that you are planning to make in the system. Our patients deserve to be able to continue to receive the best care available to them.
"The state of North Carolina's request, known as Section 115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning CCNC program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for NC Medicaid patients."
"The state of North Carolina's request, known as ""Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver"", to replace the current award-winning program (CCNC) with a complex and unconfirmed plan that could hinder established provider networks, reduce access to care, and destroy health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population."
"I have worked at a free clinic in NC for 16 years.we see people who don't have insurance, but most would qualify for expanded Medicaid if we had adopted it. Many of these people work but don't have benefits, or are just not able. We have over 6000 patients and we do what we can beaut are not able to provide the preventive care that they need, or specialy care if they need that. With Medicaid many of them could get the services they need and contribute more to society. They could also get medications they need and have easier loves"
I currently work in a pediatric office as a PA. I cannot possibly support this waiver. I have at least 80% Medicaid in my patient census. This waiver would hurt my practice and the well-being of my patients.
"I work in pediatrics in one of the poorest counties in the state (Robeson County). The Medicaid waiver will result in administrative difficulties that will not only effect the medical welfare of the patient's, but also the welfare of the practice. This change will result in decreased access to care for patients. Please deny the medicaid waiver."
"I know my comment may not ever be read, but I still need to voice my opinion. Medicaid is already a complex program. Turning Medicaid into the same structure they did for Medicare will invite all kind of fraud, waste and abuse. Like everything else they will have to expand state bureaucracies under this new plan. I can not I will not support this Medicaid reform."
"I am a FNP in Eastern NC who helps provide care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid & CCNC program."
I work in Southeastern NC and would hate to see this Medicaid Waiver pass! The residents in our county would be affected greatly......the children would not receive adequate care and would suffer if this reform was to pass. Please rethink this and do not pass this Waiver!
"As a LPN at Pediatric Clinic talk to patient families everyday and advised them to Return to the clinic or to other facilities they need to go to, due to the complex issues and multiple problems that they are going through at the time of calling."
"Please deny the medicaid waiver. I work in a pediatric office and feel that we do not need a new medicaid program, instead we need to fix the few problems that exist with the current program."
ll
"As an LPN in NC I currently work an a pediatric clinic, but I've also worked as a LPN Home Health Nurse with children and adults with complex and complicated conditions that required care from multiple specialty clinics like Duke Pediatric Neurology, UNC pediatric GI, UNC Pediatric Neurology, Urology. This reform would hurt these children and adults who lives are already complex more complicated, and their survival harder."
"The NC Medicaid reform proposed would add separate regions, PHP's, and increased amount of administrative burden. This will force children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid waiver process would make that virtually impossible. I refuse to support the proposed reform."
"As a pediatric employee in Robeson County, commonly known as one of the poorest counties in North Carolina, I cannot, will not and do not support this proposed waiver! I believe it will greatly impact the access of care for our patients. We provide care to the most vulnerable patients whose parents do not fully understand healthcare today. The proposed changes that the waiver include would only further complicate healthcare for these parents."
As a provider working in a pediatric practice I oppose the proposed waiver. A majority of our patients are Medicaid and this would limit their ability to receive the health care that they deserve.
"As a pediatric PA in NC, I would like to say that this Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. This reform is not in the best interest of the patients. It is an attempt to put a band-aid on the growing expense of healthcare. There are many children who will suffer due to these changes and I cannot abide."
"As a pediatrician , I strongly oppose the Medicaid reform. It will just make a complicated situation even more complicated."
"I work in a pediatric practice ( a corporation of 4 pediatric offices). I am concerned that the medicaid waiver will result in confusion and a great burden will be placed on the practices, thus decreasing access to healthcare. I am opposed to the medicaid waiver."
"I work at a pediatric office in NC as a nurse, and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save the Medicaid program. There are other ways to make Medicaid more successful."
"I work at a rural southeastern pediatric clinic as a pediatric nurse practitioner where we are directly involved with CCNC. I see firsthand the benefits this program provides to our NC Medicaid patients. They maintain in close communication with our pediatric Medicaid patients, limiting their ER visits, ensuring they make their specialist appointments, have adequate transportation to their specialist appointments, advising them on maintaining their well child checks, following up on patients with chronic illnesses (i.e. asthma, diabetes mellitus, etc.)."
"I work in the pediatric office in NC as a registered nurse, I do not support this change. Please deny this wavier and save our Medicaid program."
CCNC (Community Care of North Carolina) is an award winning program with this new proposed reform waiver CCNC would be eliminated. CCNC has proven to be helpful to children that receive Medicaid and now the state has proposed this waiver that is highly complex and unproven that would disrupt the whole process of providing the quality of care that our children deserve.
I strongly disagree with cutting medcaid. what happens when our children cant go to school because they don't have all the shots or ckups they need...(education)? or what happens when they cant receive dental care so they can smile pretty to? I suppose all of these things are looked over. if this medcaid change happens this will not only affect our children but what about our jobs then the unemployment rate will be on the rise again.
I am a pediatric referral nurse in south eastern North Carolina and I do not support this change. I am asking for this waiver to be denied and for the current Medicaid system be saved.
"As a provider in a pediatric clinic I oppose the switch from the current Medicaid system to 15 different entities. Continuing to make changes in the system to ""save money"" would in fact make things more confusing. Our goal is to provide the best possible care for our patients."
"As a physician assistant in NC, I ask that you decline the waiver to change medicaid and continue to use the successful program already in place. This program grants healthcare to many pediatric receipients that would otherwise have no access to health care."
"I currently work for a pediatric provider in NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have worked on reducing visits to the emergency room, and reduced costs by managing referral to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians and patients. Completely overhauling successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC."
In this bad economic times. I feel this will just make it more difficult for patients to get proper care. And the doctors will have to go through an obstacle course to get reimbursed.
"I am a LPN working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support this wavier because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system."
"As a Pediatrician in southeastern NC, I cannot support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. We see enough issues with the way Medicaid works now and I cannot imagine how much more complicated it would be under that reform. It makes more sense to fix the few issues we have now than to make everything worse! I will not support the Medicaid reform."
"I am a registered nurse in NC who helps provide care for children, most of which have medicaid. I please urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful medicaid program."
"I work for a Pediatric office in North Carolina as a receptionist and I do not support the switch from single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. Medicaid has way too many issues going on now with a complicated system, I mean me being a receptionist I see first hand how Medicaid is affecting a lot of patients with different providers on their cards so just imagine that hassle it will be when trying to deal with multiple entities."
I don't have a clue about Medicaid reform
Please reconsider making changes in the current Medicaid system. I work as a provider in a pediatric office where 70%+ of our patients have Medicaid. I do not want to see them lose the ability to receive the best possible care because they have Medicaid.
"As a parent of a child that receives Medicaid, I cannot support this waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access of care. The healthcare system is already complex and adding this new waiver would only make the system more challenging. So who is this waiver really helping?"
This Medicaid reform will just punish the segment of the population that is helpless and without power- The Children.
Don't know either way about Medicaid refrom
"AS A MEDICAL OFFICE ASSISTANT IN A PEDIATRIC OFFICE I SEE HOW THIS COULD AFFECT OUR PRACTICE, PATIENTS, FAMLIY AND MY SELF. SEEING THAT OUR PRACTICE CONSIST OF ABOUT 70% MEDICAID PATIENTS MOST OF WHICH HAVE LIFE THRETNING DIAGNOSIS THIS REFORM WILL NOT WORK FOR US HERE."
"As a PA in pediatrics, I feel that this is important to voice my concern about this proposed reform. This plan is very short-sighted and is simply a way of shirking responsibility for healthcare expenses. Many children will be poorly served if this takes place."
It makes no sense Health wise or fiscally to pass this proposed Medicaid Waiver. Stop and do the right thing for the citizens of North Carolina and do not pass this referendum.
"As a nurse in children's health in North Carolina, I see how a reform to Medicaid will be an administrative nightmare. I work in an office in which 76% of our patients receive assistance from Medicaid. Also, the company in which I work for operates in 5 different offices, each in different counties. It is possible that with the proposed changes, some of our offices may end up in different regions. I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid."
"I simply do not support the Medicaid waiver in the Medicaid Reform Plan. However, I'd support Politicians who came together to propose this nonsense and politicians who support this waiver to have to rely on this plan for their own healthcare! I could surely get behind that! Since surely they've never encountered serious or reoccurring health problems!"
"I am a Pediatrician born and raised in Robeson County, NC. I came back to practice medicine in my home county because I wanted to help improve the healthcare of the poor. I never dreamed we would be dealing with such a complicated Medicaid system, and now we are looking at a more complicated system if the proposed Medicaid reform is adopted. Please do not do this!!!"
I work for a pediatric practice in NC as a registered nurse and I am opposed to this waiver and after reading the different comments posted I have found no pediatrician thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Say no to the waiver!
"I work in the finance department of a Pediatric clinic whose patient population of Medicaid recipients are just under 80%. If this waiver isn't denied, patient care will be the start of the damning consequences many pediatric practices will face. Ultimately leading to higher unemployment rates and closed practices. Why put taxpayers at great risk when the Community Care of North Carolina program has already been well-organized and proven effective?"
I'm part of front desk staff at a pediatrics clinic in North Carolina. I feel how Medicaid reform will affect patient and their families on a daily basis. All patient receiving Medicaid will have more difficulties to received care. It could also affect my job as well. Also it will make the patients and their families care much complicated. As an employee in the Medical field I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver
"The State of North Carolina's request, known as Section 1115 Demonstration waiver, would replace the award-winning Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program with a complex and unproven model that could disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for North Carolina's Medicaid population."
I work for a pediatric practice in NC as a registered nurse and I am opposed to this waiver and after reading the different comments posted I have found no pediatrician thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Say no to the waiver!
"As a pediatric referral specialist feel that the changes to the current Medicaid system will not only affect the patients in my facility but also my family. A great majority of our patients are Medicaid recipients, who receive services everyday. These changes will cause further difficulty for these patients and myself to receive care.Medicaid reform will not only hurt those who need health services but it will also hinder the jobs of medical professionals like myself. I do not support the Medicaid Reform waiver."
THIS REFORM CAN NOT BE SERIOUS. HAVING TO BE TOLD WHEN YOU CAN GO AND NOT GO TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR...WHAT ABOUT OUR PARENTS WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE HIGH RISK MEDICAL PROBLEMS? THIS WILL NOT WORK.
I as a medical referral nurse do not support the Medicaid reform waiver.
"I'm a parent, employee, and friend. I live in one of the poorest counties in NC. Over half our county receives Medicaid. If you pass this wavier majority of this county will be affected in so many ways. Children will not get the care they need, many offices will close and the unemployment rate will rise."
"I work for a pediatric practice in NC as a registered nurse and I am opposed to this waiver. It makes sense to stick with what works, even though we have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than create more with a more complicated system."
"I am a Medical Assistant for Children's Health of the Carolina's, which is a pediatric office in the Southeastern region of North Carolina. As a crossed trained employee, I see first hand how the Medicaid reform could effect both my family, as well as our patients. Over 70% of our patients are Medicaid,and they will suffer greatly in trying to receive the quality care that they deserve. The medicaid reform makes me fear for my job security, but also saddens me that our patients will not receive quality care like those patients with United Healthcare or BCBS. I work for a company who collaborates with CCNC to ensure we provide the best care possible, and we also decreased ER visits. I do not understand why one would want to demolish a system that is working for us. I cannot support a system that does not support our patients. We treat our patients like family, and this reform is basically telling them that although we are family, I cannot give you the quality care that you deserve. I completely understand that the reform is trying to cut cost, however, is cutting cost worth losing employees and patients? Absolutely not!"
"As a pediatrician, I oppose this Medicaid reform. This just constrains the care that a provider can give but can also limit the options of the patient."
"As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I am very afraid that this new Medicaid legislation may impact my job as health care provider as well as others across the state. If this legislation passes, I fear that many health care providers may close their businesses and further limit the access to care that our Medicaid patients have. I am located in a rural county with only 3 pediatric offices and losing any of these offices, will greatly impact our Medicaid patients. There is no way that this legislation can benefit our NC Medicaid patients if providers quit their jobs and offices close their doors. However, NC legislature needs to understand that it takes money to operate an office and any lack of funds can impact keeping an office open. Also, providers are not going to stay employed by taking pay cuts because NC Medicaid chooses to greatly decrease their reimbursements."
"I am a Registered Nurse in Easter NC who helps provide care for children ,most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid program."
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, most of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina."
"I am a LPN at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in SE North Carolina. Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections. If this is accomplished under the waiver, the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices. It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming to practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."
As a registered nurse in a pediatric clinic I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities. This would impede our progress with getting patients with Medicaid the help they need.
"I am a physician assistant in Robeson County. The wavier will put our practice and to our patients at risk. I care for many complicated patients that receive care from our specialists that come to our office from Duke, UNC, and New Hanover. The waiver would restrict access to these specialists and affect the quality care they received. Please consider rejecting the waiver to help North Carolina's children."
I am currently working as a referral consultant for a pediatric clinic and I do not support the Medicaid waiver. We have worked very hard at improving care coordination and reducing costs by managing referrals. I am opposed to the proposed Medicaid Waiver for North Carolina.
"I work at a pediatric office in North Carolina as a receptionist, and I do not support this ""Medicaid"" change. I wish that you would deny the waiver and help save our Medicaid Program."
"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amounts of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for those children who are in need of advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
"My child receives Medicaid, and I also work in health care. I see first hand how the Medicaid reform will only hurt offices and patients. It is not fair to the patients that they have to suffer because they have Medicaid. Providers will not be able to adequately provide quality care."
"As a pediatrician,children which see as the most vulnerable amongst us will be affected negatively the most."
"I am a LPN in Eastern NC who helps provide care for children, most of whom have Medicaid for their health insurance. I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC Legislators to completely obliterate and ruin our successful Medicaid program and keep our current Medicaid and CCNC program."
"I work at a pediatric office in rural NC and I see no good that would come from this proposed waiver. Medicaid reimbursement is already low with this waiver payment would be almost non existent and in a county where majority of the population receive Medicaid assistance how can a doctor's office survive if payment for services are not being meet. This waiver would shut down a lot of clinics which would cause a lot of good, hard working people who care about patients to lose their jobs."
I am a registered nurse in a pediatric clinic I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they need and deserve under NC's Medicaid program.
I'm an Interpreter at a Children's Clinic in North Carolina. As an employee I see clearly how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients we see every day. The majority of patients have Medicaid and this reform will definitely will have a negative impact on their health care. I opposed this reform .

"As an office manager of a pediatric office, I do not see how the Medicaid reform will help children to get the medical care that is needed. I can see how it will make it more difficult for seeking care in low income/poor areas where a high percentage of children are receiving Medicaid.

"I am a nurse working with children. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system."
"I am a Family Nurse Practitioner at a pediatrics office in Southeastern NC which serves a diverse population,but the majority of our patients are low income and have Medicaid. As an employee I am concerned with the effects that Medicaid reform will have on our most vulnerable population. The proposed changes will have a direct negative impact on patient access to quality care and services. Reforming Medicaid will also have a negative financial impact on healthcare providers as well as our patients. I do not support the proposed Medicaid Waiver."
"The NC Section 1115 demonstration waiver is going to replace the award winning CCNC Community Care of North Carolina program with a very complex and unproven model that would disrupt established provider networks, diminish access to care, and degrade health outcomes for the NC Medicaid population. I can not support this Medicaid waiver knowing that the children of North Carolina will suffer beyond comprehension. The taxpayers of North Carolina should be outraged that our elected officials would even consider passing Medicaid reform."
"Let's say that a COMPLIANT diabetic has new symptoms arising, and has to come in every week so that the provider can monitor their health. You mean to tell me that we will not be properly compensated , therefore resulting the patient not being able to receiving quality care? This is not right at all!"
I feel as though the Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform is not feasible. I do not support this Medicaid reform.
Our corporation is 78% Medicaid. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it.
"Too many third parties representatives in a mix will only cause disaster. We are talking about people's health. This is not a game, and this reform will do nothing but hurt offices and patients."
"I currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC."

I AM A MOA (MEDICAL OFFICE ASSITANT) IN A PEDIATRICS OFFICE AND I CAN SEE FIRST HAND HOW THIS MEDICAID REFORM COULD AFFECT OUR MEDICAID PATIENTS. SOME OF OUR PATIENTS NEED TO BE SEEN MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS BECAUSE OF THEIR CONDITION WHICH MEANS WITH THE MEDICAID REFORM IT WOULD KEEP THE PATIENT FROM BEING SEEN AS OFTEN AS THEY NEEDED TO BE IF THE VISITS ARE LIMITED. PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD GREATLY AFFECT HIGH RISK CHILDREN.
I hope you take the time to read all of these comments. If you do you will see how you are going to affect so many peoples lives because of bad choices/decisions. These people that you are affecting are the people who voted you in as governor. Why would you consider destroying so many lives?

"I work at pediatric office in NC as part of the Front Desk Staff , I strongly disagree with this change . Please deny this waiver and help keep out Medicaid Program intact"
Please reject this waiver and place your efforts on improving quality healthcare services for our patients who receive Medicaid benefits.Work toward improving the system that we already have in place rather than making it more difficult to for patients to receive the care that they need and deserve.

I currently work in pediatrics. The inclusion of a Medicaid waiver would be detrimental to our practice and to my employment in a clinic where the majority of the patients have Medicaid. Our patients come to us because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging from simple to complex. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program.

I AM A MEDICAL OFFICE ASSISTANT WHO REALLY LIKES MY JOB DUE TO THE FACT THAT I KNOW THAT I CAN HELP SAVE A CHILDS LIFE. I WORK IN A PEDIATRIC OFFICE THAT IS MAJORITY MEDICAID. BEING ABLE TO SERVICE THE PATIENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY ENJOY. IF THIS ACT PASS THEN IT WILL VERY HARD TO PLEASE THE PATIENTS THAT COME IN THIS OFFICE KNOWING THE STORY BEHIND THIS ACT. TAKING MEDICAID AWAY WILL NOT ONLY MAKE ME START TO WORRY ABOUT MY JOB BUT WILL THE PATIENTS GET THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION. I HIGHLY PLEAD THAT THIS MEDICAID ACT BE REVOKED AND CONTINUE THE WAY IT HAS BEEN.
I am a pediatrician in a corporation. This waiver will not only affect patient care but also jobs. With such dramatic increase in financial burden in the administrative cost. We will be forced to lay off some of our employees to make our practice work.
As a registered nurse in the pediatric field it is not fair to punish the children of NC by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care they need. Think about the children...please consider removing the waiver to help NC's Children!
"I work at a pediatric office in NC as a Family Nurse Practitioner, and I do not support this change because it will have a negative impact on our patients and our ability to provide quality care in a timely manner.

As an employee of a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients I see first hand how this refoem is going to have a negative impact on our patients.
I am a Medical Office Assistant for a pediatric office. Over 75% of our office is comprised of Medicaid patients. The medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services.
"I work in a pediatric clinic where 3 out of every 4 patient receives Medicaid. The Medicaid reform will not work for patients, it will make it more complicated for patients and staff to navigate/understand the system.
I do not support the reform"
I am now currently working in a pediatric office in Cumberland County and Cumberland county is close to being one of the poorest counties in NC. I greatly believe that majority of our Medicaid patients will not understand the waiver and it will just complicate an already complicated system.
"I work for a Pediatric practice in North Carolina as a nurse and I do not support the switch from a single ""Medicaid"" to 15 different entities. We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now and I cannot imagine how much more complicated with will become for patients, providers, and billing who have to deal with multiple entities. It only makes sense to stick with what works, even though we do have a few issues, it would be better to fix them than to create more with a more complicated system. This would also impede our progress with getting patients with Medicaid the help they need from mental health providers."

"Without this reform, it is already a struggle for some Medicaid patients to receive the quality care that they need. This reform, and the waiver, will only make things ten times harder."

I am an nurse in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build.

Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC."
"I live in Robeson County NC, it is well known that we live in the poorest county in the state. Along with being the poorest county many of us receive Medicaid assistance, this waiver does more harm than good. It only complicates a system for people who are already struggling.

The Medicaid Reform Waiver will hinder and already weak Medicaid system. It will cause more harm than good. It is not necessary to continue to punish the children of North Carolina. Please consider moving the waiver to help North Carolina's children.

Im a single mom who lives from paycheck to paycheck already. I have to depend on the state to help with my kids medical expense.

"I understand that the state of North Carolina is in the process of Medicaid Reform and I urge you to reject the waiver put forth by NC legislators to completely obliterate and devastate the successful Medicaid program that we currently have and do away with CCNC program.

It makes not since to have 15 different entities instead of 1 that has worked so well for so long. There is not a group of providers that would benefit from this waiver going into place. The citizens that work in the health field will not be able to pay their bills and in return jobs will be lost.

I am a pediatrician. I strongly oppose the Medicaid reform. It will get in the way of how I care for my patients. Having to deal with potentially 15 different entities will just make it arduous for us not only to provide care but also 15x more difficult to get reimbursed.

"I am a nurse at a pediatric office in NC. As an employee, I see first-hand how the proposed Medicaid reform could affect my family and the patients I help every day. Most of our patients receive help from the Medicaid system and a reform would likely mean that these patients will have an even larger hurdle to jump to receive the care they need. Reforming Medicaid not only makes me fear for my job in the pediatric health profession, but it also means that the people I care for have to fight that much harder to receive the care they need. As a citizen and an employee in the healthcare field, I cannot support the proposed Medicaid waiver."
"As a physician assistant in SE North Carolina, I have many concerns regarding this waiver. NC demonstrated several years ago, with mental health, that it is no capable of competently changing major aspects of health care."
AS a registered nurse in a pediatric clinic reforming medicaid not only makes me fear for my job but it also means that the people I care for have to fight that much harder to receive the care they need.
The impoverished and the sick will be greatly affected by this Medicaid reform. In a pediatrics and I'm totally against it.

I am employed at a pediatric office in Robeson County. Our office is known for providing quality care to patients (a very high ratio of those patients receive Medicaid). I refuse to support this reform because it only provides greater difficulty for our patients to receive the quality care that they need & deserve whether their care is simple or complex they still deserve the best care possible.
I work as a PA at a public health department in NC. I am concerned that these rule changes will allow NC to syphon away even more money from public health initiatives using the money to pay private corporations.

"As a provider in a pediatric practice in Southeastern North Carolina, we see a large portion of Medicaid patients. We should not put these patients at risk for limiting access.

Please reject this Medicaid waiver."
"The Medicaid waiver included in the Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that is made up of over 75% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need.

I am opposed to the waiver and do not support a switch from 1 Medicaid entity to 15 different entities. I am greatly concerned about the proposed waiver have up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections. This will only add confusion and the administrative costs and burden will dramatically increase for the practices resulting in negative consequences. A lot of employees will have to leave the jobs that they are so passionate about helping children in our wonderful state of NC. If the waiver goes thru it will only create difficulty to receive the care that our patients deserve under the NC Medicaid Reform. You must reconsider the proposed NC Medicaid Reform.

AS A MOTHER I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE MEDICAID REFORM DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY CHILD HAS A CONDITION THAT WAS NOT ASKED FOR AND IF THERE HER SICKNESS FLARES UP THEN TRYING TO GET THE PROPER CARE FOR HER WILL BE A BIG HASSALE WHEN IT SHOULD NOT BE. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE HER WHEN AND WHERE I CHOOSE TO TAKE HER AS LONG AS SHE IS SICK. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO TRY TO TREAT A SICK CHILD AT HOME WHEN I DONT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A DOCTOR THAT CAN TREAT HER THE WAY SHE SHOULD BE. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE KIDS THAT HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT A PARENT DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER AND CAN NOT JUST MANAGE AT HOME BUT NEEDS TO BE UNDER A DOCTORS CARE.

A Medicaid reform would just make it harder for the children we provide care to get the care they need. An It would affect how many nurses a clinic would be able to employee.

As a partner in a Pediatric corporation. This Medicaid reform will require more work for as much as 6% less in reimbursement. This will mean letting go of some employees. Meaning more jobless people whose kids will fall under Medicaid. #Viciouscycle
I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS WE NEED MEICAID SERVICES FOR OUR PATIENTS
I work in a pediatric office and I strongly disagree with this Medicaid Waiver. It will completely destroy everything that pediatrics has worked so hard to build up.

The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."

I work in a pediatric office in NC. I feel that it is not in our best interest to loose our Medicaid. We have so many families that will suffer from this. If they can't get the care they need then there will surely be more diseases spreading around in all communities and our school system will also suffer. So please vote no to this wavier
"I am a mother of 9 kids and works in the medical field. I fully understand how the Medicaid reform would affect my family plus the families of patients we care for on different circumstances. Although my kids receives Medicaid, which I can not afford insurance for them due to the cost of living and meeting the needs of my kids, I need insurance and therefore I am eligible for Medicaid. Mostly all the families we see are Medicaid base pay and children are needing medical assistance. Therefore, I can not support the Medicaid waiver.

I work in North Carolina as a Nursing Assistant and I will not support the change. I hope I can help save the Medicaid Program, and I deny the waiver.

The facility where I am employed is strictly Pediatrics. We see a lot of sick children and we work diligently to proved them the best of care. With the Medicaid waiver, there is no possible way a sick child can receive the care it needs and get the best of treatment. With that been said, my job and others maybe affected due to over staff due to a cut in treatment and care.

As a mom and medical occupation, it is my Job to provide the best care to my kids and my patients. Therefore, I am totally against the Medicaid waiver, due to children needs medical care to become more healthy and productive adults.

I feel it is my place to voice my concerns, opinion for my kids and all kids of North Carolina. Please, help me support the kids of North Carolina and remove the waiver for Medicaid."

Si se limita las visitas salud de nuestros hijos que sucedera con ellos. La reforma nos afectara a todos incluso a los empleados de clínicas pediátricas que seran afectadas por el cambio y perderan sus trabajos y como mantener a sus familias. Al aceptar la reforma se pone en riezgo la salud física, mental y emocional de nuestros niños y las familia"
I am a pediatrician. I do not support this Medicaid reform. This is an affront to the helpless and vulnerable group of our society.
"The CCNC has done very well in providing access to medical care for the children of NC. The proposed overhaul & replacement of this program with an untested model would set us back in our efforts to provide good medical care for the population we serve. If Medicaid reform is to be implemented at all, it should be directed towards improving care & access for the those who utilise it, and make good use of resources already in place. The State should not waste money on costly experiments that serve only the interests of a handful who have no real interest in providing or improving care for the children of NC."
"I am strongly against this Medicaid Waiver included in Gov. Pat McCrory's Medicaid Reform Plan!

How can North Carolina or any other state in these United States not provide medical assistance to the uninsured? Shame on our legislature and anyone in the federal government for not paying attention to the uninsured!
"The CCNC program is established and has well proven competence to serve its purpose. So, from a pediatric office standpoint WHY waste hard earned tax dollars to experiment with a whole new approach? WHY risk the healthcare of high risk patients? Kids don't ask to come into this world so WHY would you suggest that we spare quality in an innocent Childs healthcare? I, myself, personally can't support this Medicaid Waiver"

"I am a Physician Assistant working in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will greatly affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand how to navigate the healthcare system, and the waiver will just complicate the entire system. The children of Robeson County come to our practice because they know they will receive quality care for issues ranging from simple to complex. I refuse to support a reform that includes a Medicaid waiver because this means our patients will have a greater difficulty to receive the care that they deserve under North Carolina's Medicaid program. Take this opportunity to show that you care not only for the wealthier locations like Charlotte and Raleigh but the poorer locations as well."
A CHANGE TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IS A NEGATIVE CHANGE FOR NORTH CAROLINA
"In North Carolina, about 244,000 adults are stuck in the 'coverage gap,' with no good way to get health insurance?
Most of them are working in industries such as retail, construction, or food service, but their incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford health insurance in the private marketplace. Also in NC, if you are a male or a female who is not pregnant and without children, it is next to impossible to get coverage in this income bracket. We really need Medicaid expansion.

For instance, a working adult without children who makes less than $11,880 a year can't get low-cost health insurance or NC Medicaid. Thank God for our Community Health Center. Also I don't believe that we need groups from outside NC to come in and run the NC Medicaid program. We have Access Care who has shown that we can care for our own without paying companies who provide jobs out of state."
"I invite the geniuses behind this load to come to the pediatric office I work for and explain to parents in one of the poorest counties in North Carolina how they came to the conclusion that the quality of healthcare for these children aren't valued.

Hold on, I'll wait!"
Please don't fix what is not broken this can cause problems for a lot of children and limit there access to doctors even more.
"I oppose the Medicaid Waiver...there are things about North Carolina Medicaid that need fixing but I feel like this is not where you should start. Think about all the people this will affect in a negative way across our state. People losing jobs because of employers not getting paid adequately for services rendered, will put people out of jobs and will only put more people on Medicaid assistance. So I ask you to please deny this Medicaid waiver because it will only overload our system worse than it already is."
"If this Medicaid waiver is set, as a healthcare provider I may lose my job. I have a family of four that I have to support. Without a job I may have to seek public assistance. Can you imagine what will happen if all who lose their jobs resort to public assistance,housing, food, clothing, and some sort of medical coverage.......All because of this meaningless Medicaid Waiver.........."

"To CMS:

I am a partner in a five office pediatric practice with offices in Raleigh, Cary, Wake Forest, Holly Springs and Clayton. We have a significant Medicaid population. North Carolina has the best Medicaid program in the nation. With good participation of positions throughout the state.

"I am a Medical Office Assistant at a pediatric corporation that is currently in three counties in Southeastern North Carolina. Our particular corporation is 78% Medicaid patients/families. Not only will this affect the families that receive Medicaid, it will drastically affect our corporation. Considering that the state of North Carolina is already a state of poverty. This waiver itself will cause many children to be turned away from our pediatric office, because we would no longer be able to accept Medicaid due to the waiver. I believe the waiver that is soon to be passed will do more bad than it will good for the people of North Carolina. I hope that the North Carolina legislators do not approve of this waiver, because it would greatly affect my job security."
"I am the office manager for a pediatric practice in Greensboro NC.
Please do not pass this proposed change to NC Medicaid system. In the last few years our state has done little to help the most vulnerable population in NC.... this would be one more blow.
July 1, 2013 our state changed the Medicaid system rom EDS to NC Tracks at the cost of millions perhaps billions of taxpayer dollars. it was not an easy transition for many providers and patients. It was to be a cost effective move......if so why do we need another change that will be much more onerous for providers and patients:
because someone has figured out a way to make a profit from already hard working physicians & our poorer population of patients ?How do you then justify all the money just spent ???
Please help care for our dwindling supply of primary care physicians and our people.

"The waiver is not good for the children of NC. Increased MCOs up to 15 allowed in waiver, increased complexity, rules, decreased participation by PCPs and Specialist networks, uncertain reimbursement including possible capitation that will be determined by for-profit entities based on shareholder interests. Loss of CCNC a nationally recognized entity with proven quality and cost containment success. Loss of an efficient Medicaid system, noting that with reimbursements less than ½ of private insurers, the only way pediatricians can continue to see Medicaid patients is with an efficient Medicaid system and the waiver will destroy efficiency causing pediatricians to stop taking Medicaid. This will reduce access to quality care for children, our most vulnerable population. Include any personal stories, if you have them, on how the similar experiment of mental health reform/privatization has not worked in NC, especially with children. This is a waste of tax payer money and the legislature failed to listen to the overwhelming public comment against the waiver before sending it on to CMS a political process failure for NC."
"As so many before, I oppose this waiver."
The pediatric cooperation I am employed with serves children in three counties and is about 75% Medicaid. If this Medicaid waiver is passed I feel like our patients would not receive the care that they deserve under the Medicaid program. My children are not on Medicaid assistance but if this passes my job could be affected and could possibly put them and myself needing Medicaid coverage. NC should treat all patients equally regardless of how their bill will be paid. I strongly oppose this referendum and don't see how this will benefit our Medicaid program.
Please take a moment and take into consideration the numerous pediatric patients and pediatric employees' livelihood you're dealing with here.
"As of now Offices are having enough issues with the current Medicaid right now, however if this waiver is passed it will be almost impossible to deal with. I have not spoken to any Pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients of their practice."
"We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now without it being more complicated for our Providers, Patients, and Billers to handle."
"We see enough issues with the way Medicaid is now without it being more complicated for our Providers, Patients, and Billers to handle."
"Without expanding Medicaid via the Affordable Care Act to cover adults, the improvement to the health and well-being of North Carolinians under the waiver is limited. Making sure that parents of children on Medicaid also have health insurance and a health home is sorely needed."
"I am a Pediatrician with a rural pediatric practice that covers 4 counties with three office locations. My practice is well over 70% Medicaid. Over the years I have added numerous services thru my practice to help provide the most coverage for my patients without having to refer to area Medical centers. This has been a great convenience to my patients and a huge savings for Medicaid. I have jumped thru hoops to keep the quality of my practice at a superior level for my patients.
My practice has almost 50 employees. Under the current CCNC system I am able to barely maintain my practice but if there is a cut in Medicaid funding, I'm sure I will have to cut personnel and may also have to close one of my offices. This would be a huge lost for the four counties that my practice, the only Pediatric practice in this area, covers."

No everyone will not be affected but a large majority will...directly or indirectly, Don't try and fix what's not broken."
"As an Interpreter in the pediatric field I feel it is very important to express my discontent for the Medicaid reform. Children that have Medicaid are struggling to get health care.

I strongly suggest removing, the waiver to help NC must precious children."

"As the Practice Manager of an independent Pediatric Office in Mecklenburg County, I respectfully request that the proposed structure of PHP's in the proposed 1115 Waiver be reworked. At present, the administrative burden of Medicaid patients is high driven by largely by complexity and redundancy. At best, this portion of the practice is breakeven financially. To require the additional barriers to entry that a PHP system as written will bring, will force this practice to turn away its Medicaid patients. Or, as parents come on hard time, we will be forced to turn away long time patients, many of which have complicated histories and need our healthcare support.

Medicaid children, especially, need accessible pediatric care. Please consider the consequences that the details of the Waiver will drive. Our Medicaid program in North Carolina isn't perfect, but it works. Please don't eviscerate the good work that the NC DMA and CCNC programs do!"
I work at Pediatric Office in NC . I don't understand how this proposal to Medicaid will help those children in need. It will cause a problem on every one including administrative staff and patients and their family
I currently work in pediatrics in Hudson County. The Medicaid waiver will affect our practice and my employment due to Medicaid high ratio
Please expand medicaid now!
I support Medcaid
"As a pediatrician in NC, I believe this is not a good plan and is going to make healthcare worse for a lot of children."
"I am currently employed in a clinic that is predominately Medicaid, and it will effect all 5 clinics."

I'm an interpreter at a Pediatric office in NC and I totally oppose to the waiver. This will damage the relationship and trust we have earned with our patient It is unnecessary and unfair. No Doctors or Office staff agree with this.
"I oppose the Medicaid waiver included in Gov McCrory's Medicaid Reform Plan. I don't see how it is feasible. Many patients lives will be affected. These changes stated in this waiver are just added barriers will only complicate the access and level of healthcare our patients need. As an employee in a pediatric office, I urge you to consider removing the waiver to help all North Carolina children be given a chance for quality healthcare. CCNC is doing a great job!"
I'm front staff at Pediatric Office and I reject the waiver with all my heart. The NC legislators need to cancel this proposal. We need to think about the well being of our children
"All of the people in North Carolina deserve some access to health care. Working a low wage job you cannot afford to pay for health insurance, and you cannot afford the ridiculous prices the healthcare industry charges. Hospitals just gouge you on every product.

The Governor needs to extend the same privileges he and other legislators have and give the people of the State the same benefits.
Every needs to have access to healthcare."

"I don't support the switch from single Medicaid to 15 different entities. There are a lot issues with current Medicaid system . These Medicaid reform will worsen everything , specially the children of NC . I'm part of Front Office"
I'm an Interpreter/ front staff at Pediatric clinic in NC and I'm very much concern about our patients that need our care and treatment. Also I'm concern about my employment. Please reconsider this Medicaid reform which is not going to benefit anyone. Thank you
"I work in pediatric clinic In NC , I don't support this proposal . Deny this waiver . Please save our Medicaid current system."
I'm part of front desk in a pediatric office in NC and I cannot support the proposed reform to Medicaid. This proposal is not helping NC 's children receive the care they need.
Please stop degrading our health system in NC. I work at Pediatric office and disapprove this Medicaid reform. Think about our patients and their families
Governor Pat McCrory needs to reconsider the Medicaid reform plan . This plan is not good for our children . As an employee in a pediatric office that consist of 76 % or more Medicaid patients I fear for the health care of these children.
"To Whom it May Concern,

As a single mother of 5 adopted children, who were adopted right here in Buncombe County, their Medicaid is a miracle life saver. However, over the years I have seen it decline and choices become lessened. I adopted an entire family of children to keep them together for life and each of them carry DNA of the biological parents who both had multiple mental health issues. It is sad to know our state is not only looking out for adopted children, but all children who rely on Medicaid for the medical issues. I implore our state to approve the Medicaid Expansion. We cannot continually take away from our youth and expect to have a secured future. The great state of NC will pay for these mistakes if the right actions are not taken now to protect, save and educate our youth. I support the Medicaid Expansion, please join me; a single mom just trying to raise five healthy, smart and productive citizens of NC.
Sincerely,

Lisa Barlow"
"Please vote for Medicaid Expansion. The Women, children and elderly suffer the most from this coverage gap. Show us, your constituents, that you care about us and want us to be healthy and productive. This is already subsidized from the Federal Government and we should not turn our back on this financial help. Jane Brown Willig, 28714"
I work in a Pediatric office in NC as a Facility Coordinator and I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities.
"As an employee in a pediatric office in NC , I need to express my concerns. I fear for NC children's appropriate health care and their family. I'm also concern for my employment ,my family could be affected too. This Medicaid reform is absurd, it will inconvenience everyone . I strongly suggest to improve the current Medicaid system and lets all work together for the benefit of our children. Thank you"
"I work as a Medical Assistant in North Carolina. Patients will see a decrease in care if this reform goes through. How can we say we love our patients, & give them poor quality care?"
"""I work in a Pediatric Office in NC as a Mental Health Manager"" and I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities."
"MY wifea and I volunteer as Navigators for the ACA. It is heart breaking to see families who are working 3 jobs, and still don't make enough to afford healthcare for the parents. Don't let our govenor negotiate a separate deal for NC. Make them live up to the ACA provisions of expanded Medicaid. Get all of our citizens covered, and especially parents of children. Better yet just give everyone access to Medicare and be done with the absurdity of ACA. ACA is really the Protect the Pharmicueticals Program or a part of the Republican Program to Punish the Poor. Enough already!!!

Don't let NC privatize our Medicaid program so that corporations reap the benefits instead of the citizens who need these services. It not about making profits, it is about providing effiecient health care services for all of our citizens. Don't be fooled by the old propoganda that the private sector can do everything more efficietnly. They can't and don't when it comes to health care. Just expand Medaid through the DHSS. McCorey doesn't care about patients he cares about the donors to his campaign."
"I request that CMS carefully consider any changes to NC's Medicaid system before moving forward to approve the submitted 1115 waiver. While I recognize that payment reform is coming quickly in all sectors of healthcare, I have great hesitations about the plan submitted by NC, including:
- Administrative burden to participating Medicaid providers. The complexities of having providers align with and report to multiple and overlapping Provider-Led Entities and Managed Care Organizations could cause undo hardship to Medicaid providers, especially smaller independent practices. There is currently over 90% participation rate for primary care in NC, and to keep that we will need statewide, uniform supports to all practices that want to participate.
- Administrative burden and confusion for Patients. Having Medicaid plan options that mirror complicated private market coverage with shifting provider networks and disjointed care coordination seems a burden to patients whose resources are already limited. A system of Navigation may be needed such as we had to create when NC declined a State-run Health Exchange for ACA coverage.
- Dismantling of award-winning, cost-saving, localized infrastructure of Community Care of NC. It is unclear to me what, beyond the State gaining budget predictability by removing their own responsibility to the beneficiaries, is the intent of Medicaid Reform when data-driven cost and quality measures are working in NC and costs are around 50th in the nation for Medicaid spending growth. Require the State to keep Community Care of NC in tact as much as possible if you approve the waiver and want reform to succeed. Both its provider network and its care management services.
-Lack of Medicaid Expansion. Require this to be part of any Medicaid Reform plan that occurs in North Carolina. Why reform twice? Have the system respond to changes in structure and scope simultaneously. Expanding service to those under 100% of poverty level and eliminating the unjustifiable coverage gap should be part of the transformation.
Thank you."
Expand Medicaid! A healthy population is a more productive one.
"As a LPN in the pediatric medical, I feel it's imperative to voice my concerns for the Medicaid reform. I see, first-hand, how children insured by Medicaid struggle to get the healthcare they need. The suggested reform, including the waiver, will make this process even harder. It's not fair to punish the children of NC by increasing the number of hurdles they must cross in order to receive the care that they need. Please consider removing the waiver to help NC children!"
"What about our patients who are high risk, and are in need of several specialists visits. Has whoever thought of this waiver began to think about that category?? I am totally against the Medicaid Waiver."
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medical program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affect my job. I do not see how NC can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for NC."
The reform will only make it harder for our kids to get the care they need. We currently have problems with Medicaid and the reform will only make things worst. It will affect our kids and our families. I work at a pediatrics office and fear that I may lose my job since most of our patients are Medicaid recipients. I cant support the reform. I cant support something that will affect my family and the health of our children.
"I continue to be disappointed and frustrated that NC has not participated in Medicaid Expansion. It is a great opportunity to help ensure that more low income families will be able to prepare their children for successful futures. It will also help protect our hospitals from having to foot the bill for as many uninsured patients. Please expand Medicaid in NC! Thank you,

"I am a medical office assistant at a pediatric practice that is 78% Medicaid. The Medicaid waiver will effect a lot of families in Southeastern North Carolina. Practice's will stop wanting to see patients due to Medicaid not wanting the pay the appropriate amount of money. ER's and Urgent Care Center's will become more crowded once again due to the lack of funds being paid by Medicaid. Not only will this effect families, it will effect hard working American's such as myself because we are not being paid appropriately by Medicaid. The waiver in Medicaid could possible destroy private practices. Who could afford to stay open when most of the patients have Medicaid but Medicaid doesn't pay??? If Medicaid doesn't pay, people working in health care will get paid less or possibly terminated. How can they afford to feed their families?? It would become a vicious cycle. But, if the government is okay with taking money from hard working American's and making it hard to find health care because Medicaid is shit, then I guess it's ok. Why take healthcare advantages from those that can't afford any other healthcare. Practices won't have any other choice but to limit their services for Medicaid recipients because they would be losing money. I would like for this Medicaid waiver to be reconsidered because it would do more bad than good. Take a closer look and see how it would effect those who are not as fortunate as those who work with the government."

Support those North Carolinians without health insurance to stay or become healthy and contribute to our states well being.. Too much has been given to the upper clas and now support the middle and poorer classers. Thank you!

"Requiring North Carolina to expand Medicaid as a condition of the waiver would implement the legislative intent behind the ACA. It also advances national goals to create a healthier population.
Under the ACA, Medicaid expansion was an integral part in order to provide health insurance for the working poor who can't afford to buy the subsidized policies in the exchange. The early experience in other states shows that the new Medicaid enrollees begin getting regular care and start addressing chronic health issues, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and obesity. They are healthier at work and are freed from the fear that one trip to the ER will bankrupt them. By helping the working poor to climb to the middle class, this strengthens communities.
For providers, expansion is necessary to replace some lost federal revenue. With Medicaid receipts, they save money on charity care and can thus consider increasing services.
North Carolina is a national leader in providing high-quality, cost-effective care for Medicaid recipients.
Medicaid expansion is a vital part of creating a healthier, more productive America with greater financial security and lower healthcare expenses for all.

"I work at a pediatric office in NC. I do not support the switch from a single Medicaid to 15 different entities! This will just complicate the process--no longer one set of rules, one insurance card, single place to call for overrides, billing questions, prior approvals, etc.! This change will not save money and just complicate patient care!"
Please see our attached comments.
"As a medical student, I recently learned that about 40% of patients seen at community health centers in NC are uninsured. By not accepting the Medicaid expansion the state of North Carolina is actively denying healthcare coverage to many of these people who are seeking care as well as thousands more who do not because of the potential cost.

Legislators - do the right thing and help the people of your state access cost-effective, preventative healthcare. Please accept the Medicaid expansion and support community health centers.

- Anna McKinsey"
I support this effort 100%.Our citizens need this.
"Please provide Medicaid to people who do not qualify for marketplace insurance. Just because they are not blind, aged, or disabled or without underaged children should not exclude people from healthcare aid."
Please extend Medicaid in our state. It is truly needed.
I support Medicaid. I think Medicaid provides the opportunity for families that can not afford healthcare cost. I depend on Medicaid to help support unexpected expenses.
"I am a pediatrician practicing in Robeson County-one of the poorest counties in the state of NC. I see the struggles that my patients and parents deal with daily navigating the Medicaid system and I see nothing but more problems if the waiver is approved. It is totally unacceptable that a legislative-mandated Medicaid reform waiver survive that addresses nothing but cost savings to the state. As a pediatrician, we all have worked extremely well with Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) to provide needed cost savings to the state but more importantly greatly improve the quality of care received by the citizens. If the waiver passes, we will be in a survival mode and unfortunately quality will suffer as a result. I REALLY encourage CMS to not approve the waiver in its current form until quality issues are better defined and the system for the patients is simplified."
"Please extend Medicaid for the low income adults without children. We need assistance too.
It's not like all of us are lazy. Some of us work 2 jobs to make ends meet, but still not enough for healthcare.
Please take this into consideration and help us to stay healthy. It's not as costly if we can seek medical attention proactively instead of reactively."
Do the right thing and support the health needs of our neediest people in this great state.
I would like to expand medicaid

"I am a Medicaid recipient, disabled and living on SSI. In the past year I have seen some of my Medicaid benefits disappear. Prescriptions I have been taking for years are being denied to me one by one. The last time I looked over the benefits online, I found that vision tests and eyeglasses are no longer covered. How am I to get those things now? I need glasses badly and my quality of life, which isn't great at present, is suffering because of that. Still living with me is my youngest daughter, who is 24. She would so much love to leave home, but she has never had a job, and any job available to her here would be minimum wage. She can't have Medicaid. Most of NC hasn't enjoyed the recovery from the recession that some folks think we have. There are only spots in the state that have more jobs. The years we've spent here under Republican rule have injured this beautiful place, where I've lived all my life, in many ways. Now our government wants to replace the care we're getting with even worse care. No matter what rosy words they've included in their request, it's all utter bunkum. The idea of cutting costs per person rather than increasing services per person makes me shiver. I really don't know whether the cutbacks in Medicaid that already exist here come from the state or federal level. When we have a for-profit company overseeing our health with the intent of cutting costs, things will only be worse. I am not in favor of that at all. Most of all, we need the Medicaid expansion. There are at least a half-million people here without health insurance. Must they die by the side of the road? Surely some of them have no computer, so I write on their behalf. By all means, deny North Carolina this waiver."
"Governor McCrory is out of touch with the working class and the working poor citizens of North Carolina. Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) is a Medicaid managed care model that has helped our Medicaid recipients both young and old. This model has saved the state millions and millions in Medicaid dollars over the years that the 14 networks have been in existence. To totally leave this program out of the Medicaid reform plan is about as stupid as the day Governor McCrory and Dr. Vos announced to the media that Medicaid in NC was broken, while that very same day, CCNC received an award for the excellent work the program has done for the Medicaid program in NC. This award was presented by Senator Richard Burr and during that presentation it was revealed that other states were looking to North Carolina and applauding the success of the program. These states wanted to duplicate this managed care model in their own states. Please don't leave out CCNC! Governor McCrory doesn't even know what a jewel CCNC in the care given for its patients. It is working in our state and Medicaid isn't broken!"
"If the Governor of North Carolina was really interested in serving the needs of the people of our state he and the state legislature would have already accepted the Medicaid Expansion offered through the Affordable Care Act.

I urge the federal government to stop the State of North Carolina's attempt to privatize Medicaid. This is nothing more than an effort to take over of an efficiently run government program and replace it with private for-profit corporations who will serve fewer people at a higher cost and with lower quality of care. The goal of these corporations is to make profits--NOT TO SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

Thank you.

"I'm a mom of 2 boys ( 17 & 22 ) and I work 29-30 hours per week at $7.25 as a pizza delivery driver, while attending a medical coding certificate program in college. Yet I was DENIED Medicaid. I bring home approximately $850 per month and was told I make too much money. We MUST change this Medicaid program in NC! I can barely pay our monthly bills and was denied health insurance through the Marketplace because they said I should qualify for Medicaid. Therefore myself and my children have no medical insurance. I have high blood pressure and cannot afford a dr visit to have them give me a prescription for blood pressure medication. So when my blood pressure gets too high I will eventually have a stroke. Thanks to Government McCrory this is a real possibility."
"I am a general pediatrician in Raleigh, NC, and I am strongly opposed to the model set forth in the NC proposed 1115 Waiver. This complicated system very likely will reduce children's access to health care. A large percentage of children in NC will be adversely affected by the proposed waiver. The proposed model does not adequately take child health into account and should not be implemented across North Carolina. CCNC has been a huge asset and resource to me as a practicing pediatrician and from a public health standpoint-- for the well-being of children in the state. It absolutely should continue. I do not know what we would do without it."
"Stop changing the system over and over, there are too many changes and hoops to jump through. Too many ""others"" making decisions on a child or an adult, other than the doctors. The panels are grossly negligent and the majority of the people using this system are confused by all the rule changes every year. Children and adults on Medicaid need a system that doesn't keep changing, that doctors and local care givers have more to say than doctor panels, medicine that was once included like cough medicine or antacid medicine are paid for by the system. Stop trying to make this all inclusive as that never works and then services are cut even further because there are even more on the system. We have enough hoops to get on the system and to stay on the system, stop trying to make it more difficult for those already on the plan."
"it is a sad day in america when people who are trying hard to make a living and can not afford health insurance and then our state turns their back on them. How can anyone look themselves in the mirror knowing someone is sick, or needs attention. This goes without mentioning that statistics bare out the facts that access to and preventative care reduce the cost to the state and insurance companies. Do the right thing, help out the 1/4 of a million folks who slip thru the gap!

"Oh dear god, think about what you are doing. Dividing Medicaid up to for-profit companies will help only one entity, the for-profit company. They will scrape profits out of the tax payer's dollars and reduce the money to pay for needed services and to pay for those working on behalf of the patients. The physicians and the Medicaid patients will be hurt by this.

You can tell yourself that ""competition will lead to cost savings,"" which is all fine and dandy in a free market, but ask anyone who understands the economics of healthcare. It does not behave like a free market, especially when all the services are ""free"" to the consumer."
"Hi, I am a pediatrician in Burlington, NC. I have concerns regarding the NC Medicaid waiver that cause me to be opposed to it as it is currently presented. It does not adequately address how access to care will be maintained for children, especially those who are medically fragile. There is no infrastructure that upholds access to promise and specialty care providers. The waiver also does not support the maintenance of CCNC, which I believe to be integral to Medicaid. CCNC has played an integral role in helping to provide the support needed to optimize care for many of our patients. I hope the NC DHHS and legislature will be more receptive to the feedback of the people whom are affected most in the dialogue-- children and medical providers-- as they consider future changes."
Please include Medicaid expansion in your reform. 86 people a month are dying because they don't have proper medical coverage due to financial restraints. This is important for everyone living in north Carolina!!!
"Failure to expand medicaid will not save money, it will inevitably increase costs in eventual health care. Uninsured North Carolinian will be forced to seek care in our Emergency Departments, the most costly care. And those costs will be born by those of us who have insurance and those who pay out of pocket. Now is the time to expand Medicaid in North Carolina. Fiscally and morally it is the right thing to do."
NC's plan to reform Medicaid should include closing the coverage gap.
"State Senator Angela Bryant - Sen. Dt. 4 - Nash, Halifax, Vance, Warren and Wilson Counties. I strongly urge NC to expand medicaid as a part of the managed care reform. In eastern North Carolina - health care costs are exorbitant primarily because of the unfunded care due to the coverage gap. We have some of the highest health disparities in the country in our region due to this coverage gap. It is also important that the statewide and regional plans be identical in terms of administrative procedures in order to be cost efficient and provider friendly especially for eastern NC where costs are higher and providers are scarce and hard to recruit and keep. It would be unconscionable to increase the administrative burden on already overloaded providers with anything other than IDENTICAL Administrative procedures under these managed care plans. Thanks. Sen. Angela R. Bryant, Rocky Mount NC."
"As a physician, I am ashamed of our state's refusal to expand the medicaid program. It is obscene that hard working citizens cannot afford health care in this country and this state. Any ""reform"" of Medicaid by a Republican leader in NC will be to shunt tax dollars into corporate profit, leaving less money available for medical care."
"We need to provide health care access for up to 500,000 low income citizens of North Carolina (25% of whom are children) who fall in the gap between medicaid eligibility and ACA subsidies. The vast majority of these are hardworking folks or students with sometimes 2-3 jobs, none of which provide affordable benefits. These people are not freeloaders! They are the backbone of our economy and they deserve to be acknowledged by North Carolina and treated with the dignity they deserve."
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!"
"I have practiced primary care pediatrics in North Carolina across a number of settings for the past 30 years. I do not understand why the NC General Assembly is so set on reforming a program that has proven to reduce costs of care while improving health. Over 70% of Medicaid recipients in NC are children. Children and the pediatric practitioners who care for them will bear the brunt of any changes to a system that is not even broken to begin with. In many rural practices, like the one I worked in the past year, the number of children insured by Medicaid exceeds 75%. Medicaid reimbursement is already less than private insurance that is offset somewhat by timely reimbursement and having to deal with only one insurer -- the state . I fear that with the proposed changes, billing will become an expensive nightmare for practitioners. Recruiting and retaining pediatric practitioners to care for children in need areas is hard enough and I'm afraid the proposed Medicaid waiver will make that task even harder. Practices in more affluent areas will just limit the number of Medicaid patients they admit, but in rural areas where an overwhelming percentage of children are Medicaid insured that will not be possible, so I'm afraid newly minted pediatricians will just go elsewhere - possibly even to other states."
"North Carolina's application for Medicaid Reform shows North Carolina's poor planning to provide health care to our most vulnerable citizens. I am a retired adolescent medicine pediatrician who has served the adolescent population that is not able to pay for private medical care. The obvious answer is for North Carolina to expand Medicaid as planned under the Affordable Care Act. People's lives are at stake. It is the right thing to do.

"Expanding Medicaid is critical. It's critical for our economy, for our rural health care providers and, most importantly, for our people who don't have the insurance that is so vital to gaining access to proper health care. Medicaid should have been expanded long ago, but late is better than never. This decision affects the real lives of real people."
We need Medicaid expansion. Help our families.
"Dear CMS,

There are nearly 2000 comments submitted by concerned patients, health care providers and advocates almost all expressing horror that a well-managed, cost effective Medicaid program that has broad based support among nearly the entire health care community in North Carolina could be dismantled. Why does the current legislature wish to wash their hands of responsibility for budgeting and managing a $3.5 billion dollar program? It is because of the power of a few well-placed Legislators to force this program into passage. Most legislators I have talked to about their vote in favor of the Waiver have little understanding of the consequences of their vote. The only group that will benefit by this Waiver is the managed care companies that, by law, are awarded over $400 million dollars in management fees to accomplish what currently costs the state 1/3. The people that are affected by your decision to accept the Waiver cannot match the hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations funneled into creating this law. We can write comments, educate and try to affect change. In the political world this amounts to a deaf ear. Our last and best hope is CMS will look at the Waiver with a jaundiced eye as to why it is necessary in the first place. It is bad legislation for the taxpayers of North Carolina and the United States. It is bad legislation for the children and their physician advocates.

"Medicaid is an important part of my clients lives. It allows them the health care and services to keep them healthy physically and mentally. Please look into the bottom line of removal of services which will cause those services to shift to the ER's, Urgent cares and that will be more expensive.

Look at the Medicare System and make it more of a tiered system. Not taking all the benefits away, but allowing patients to climb out of the depth of government aid. Give incentives to have patients gain healthy behaviors. Provide negative consequences to those who do not meet healthy behaviors."
"I have been a nurse for almost 30 years, concentrated in the area of Women's & Children and currently in the area of Pediatrics. I have worked both in the hospital and office settings. I currently work in an office that is 40% medicaid and cares for two-thirds of the the county's 3 and under population. Of course that doesn't include the other 6 surrounding county's pediatric population we provide care for! Trying to provide the excellent care for these children would be a challenge if there were different regulating bodies for that 40%. Trying to obtain prior authorizations for medications, imaging, procedures or even trying to obtain referrals to pediatric specialists would become an absolute nightmare. Having CCNC locally helps us to ensure our community provides that excellent care. If I am having difficulty helping a family find a resource I can pick up the phone and speak with someone who knows our patients and the community resources available. This would change completely if I several, up to 15 I've been told, insurances regulate just medicaid. Please consider this when making your decision. We wish to continue providing the excellent care for our patients and our community."
"Changing Medicaid from fee for service to a managed care system would be a disaster for those children who are actually being very well managed by their pediatricians in their medical homes across the state. If this change will be turns out to be modeled after the chaotic, poorly managed mental health care system that Medicaid patients now have to wade through you can bet on less access, long wait times for authorizations, abysmal reimbursements, and sicker children as a result. Say NO to this proposal."
"As a general pediatrician in private practice in Alamance County, I am highly concerned that North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Demonstration is not in the best interest of our youth. My practice would be unable to to work with more than 1 or 2 MCOs, as this would be impossible for our billing department. This would further restrict our Medicaid population. Based on current Medicaid claims and reimbursement, my practice has already needed to stop accepting new Medicaid patients who have relocated to the county or who are born at our local hospital, unless they have an older sibling in the practice. My practice is also weary of accepting the increased risk associated with a capitated system. Historically, we have had negative results with this model. Pediatricians provided overwhelming concern to NC DHHS during the Listening Sessions and feedback period that the NC Medicaid Reform Demonstration will increase complexity and make use difficult, limit access to care, and do away with CCNC, despite its national recognition for proven quality and cost containment. I am disappointed that these concerns did not result in any substantial changes to the waiver submitted to CMS."
"Please do what is right to protect children who are in need. Medically fragile children and their families should be sustained because having a sick loved one is already the most vulnerable place to be, and if my tax money can support them as they need it, or until they are well, or able to be independent again, that is the American value system we should support. As our country is demonstrating that we have lost our moral compass daily in the media, do what is worthy to protect those who cannot lift up themselves."
"PART 1 of 2
As a family doctor at a busy urban community health center, I do my best to care for each patient I see that day. While ""Population medicine"" – thinking about the care of our entire community – is important work, it is hard to fit into a day filled with direct patient care. Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) has been my partner – the partner of so many of us primary care doctors – in improving care for our state's Medicaid patient population.

CCNC helps me to:

1. Keep up with evidence-based guidelines. CCNC lets me know when my patients with asthma, diabetes, heart conditions or strokes are not filling medications. They also lets me know how I am doing compared with other practices on these measures. CCNC even arranges get-togethers of doctors to go over these things.

2. Give the right care at the right time. CCNC lets me know when my patients are showing up at the Emergency Department during business hours with non-urgent problems. They then help patients understand how best to access the most appropriate care.

3. Wrap appropriate services around my most complex patients. For patients with multiple or severe problems that are hospitalized, CCNC staff will visit them – often at home – and make sure they are able to get medicines and can safely get around their home.

4. Have vital information. CCNC has created a ""Provider Portal"" through which I can see the names and numbers of my patients' other doctors or therapists so that we can more easily coordinate care. I can even see the names of the medicines they are filling and the dates they picked it up from which pharmacy.

5. Have direct communication. My local CCNC network's staff has taken the extra (and arduous) steps to become integrated into my system so that they can send me messages about our shared patients directly in that person's electronic medical record.

6. Build relationships around the primary care office. I recently had a patient whose kidneys had taken a turn for the worse. Through a quick phone call to CCNC's Community Pharmacist program, I was able to find out that another doctor had started giving him a medicine around the time he started to have problems. Also I had a patient who needed assistance getting appropriate behavioral health care. At my CCNC network meeting, I ran into exactly the person who could help.

"Urging Medicaid Expansion...Health care is a right for everyone. Yet, in spite of the numbers of people who are, in fact, working, many low-paying jobs do not provide healthcare benefits. This leaves families going without healthcare, hundreds of whom die each year because their illnesses are neglected for too long. While many children are covered under Medicaid, their parents are not...what sense does this make and how does it help these children in the long run. Our ER's are overrun with people who have no other option. This is an added expense to our Hospital systems, putting many of them in financial difficulty. This money has been set aside by our Federal Government...please, put it to good use for the fine people of NC who are less fortunate."
"NC's proposed Medicaid waiver is simply the result of partisan politics at its worst. Multiple independent audits have verified that per beneficiary spend rates are among the lowest, if not the lowest, in the country and the delivery model continues to produce lower medication and hospital readmission rates. Simply put, existing care models are yielding savings and quality outcomes. Yet our legislators want to dismantle this system and introduce expensive administrative duplication and unnecessary complexity. Providers and beneficiaries alike will not be better served by this ill-conceived, gap-riddled waiver. Secretary Brajer has been quoted recently as saying the Medicare system in NC isn't broken. I can fully embrace innovation if there's a reasonable chance patients will be better served and population health improved. The ""system"" outlined in the waiver will leave too many of the neediest patients underserved, while giving out-of-state for-profit insurers a better bottom line. This isn't meaningful progress or innovation. Do the citizens, providers and Medicaid patients in NC a huge favor by denying this waiver to the state health plan."
"Part 2 of 2
The systems and relationships used to achieve all of these successes took years to build. It's an organization for which quality is the goal, not profit. It is hard to understand the goal of our legislature's ""patient-centered"" Medicaid reform. How does disrupting these existing, working relationships help patients? How does allowing private companies to carve profit out of our tax dollars help North Carolina as a whole? How does carving up NC's population into pieces and giving bits to one and bits to another company make any sense? Why has our legislature not offered to expand Medicaid if they think this plan is a good one?

In my 16 years of practice, I have seen private insurance companies make more and more money by giving less care to patients and less money to doctors. My hope is that the federal government will DENY our legislature's request for a waiver to privatize N.C. Medicaid, so that CCNC can continue the good work it's doing and has done for year.

Thanks for listening.

"I am a pediatric nurse in North Carolina. I have seen a lot of changes in the healthcare system in the past 17 years. I feel changing Medicaid from a single Medicaid payor to 15 different payors would be detrimental to not only patients but all pediatric practices.
This change would greatly impact our CCNC program which has grown to be a wonderful cost savings program for our government along with improving patient's continuity of care. The case managers with CCNC have opened up a greater communication between not only the patients, their families and the providers of service but also with community resources unknown to many families and providers.
In the Fall a 5yr old little boy with medicaid visited our practice for a routine kindergarten exam. He failed the hearing exam so our provider referred him out to a local audiologist for further evaluation. This patient was diagnosed with hearing loss and fitted for hearing-aids. He also needed an assistive device for the classroom to help with his learning due to hearing difficulties. Per the school he did not fit the criteria for special needs so the school did not have monies in their budget to purchase the very expensive hearing device for the classroom. The parents did not have resources to purchase this machine so I spoke with our CCNC case manager who began to help investigate this case.
The CCNC case manager made multiple contacts with the Audiologist, family, school and community to locate any possible resources to be able to purchase this equipment for the classroom. She even attended several meetings with the family and school system to discuss the patient's needs and make sure everyone knew what was needed and expected. After multiple calls CCNC nurse manager procured the funds to purchase the machine for the classroom and it will now follow him the through his school career.
Without CCNC, and our current medicaid system our practice would not have been able to act as quickly as we did with the referral process to determine his hearing disability. We would not have had a case manager to coordinate all of the meetings and communication between providers, parents, school system, and community resources. This child now has a greater opportunity to learn and become a productive adult because of the way our system is able to help children and families. I beg that you do not disrupt our currently working system. Stephanie Deaton RN, Pediatric nurse for 17 years"
"I am a pediatrician in Moore and Hoke Counties on North Carolia. I love our Community Care of NC Medicaid program. We take care of over 20,000 children on Medicaid and CHIP. I have extensively used our community-based care coordinators. After practicing at a we funded children's hospital in Washington, I had concerns on how I would be able to coordinate community care in my new practice. Our community care program has allowed be to coordinate social resources that support fragile infants that have multiple health care needs and make sure that their families have the resources and support they need to care for their children. Our nurses go into these families homes, explain their medications and medical equipment, and ensure that the children have transportation to their appointments. These nurses have also gone to the homes of my morbidly obese teen ages to help clean out their pantries and help them improve their home health environments so they are not led to sequelae that with make them burdensome to the adult medication community.

Our children establish health behaviors at a young age. It is of great importance that we support programs that will nurture their health and development. Prevention of disease and the establishment of healthy habits will make adults that have fewer preventable illnesses and reduce health care spending overall.

I have reviewed the proposed 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services. I am opposed to your approving this waiver because I do not think private insurance companies can reinvent Community Care. Under Community Care, we work with one payer and one community-based care coordination system. Our current system is more efficient and supports practices focusing on the promotion of health care. Let's focus on what is important and not replace a slightly imperfect system with what we can see as clearly inefficient. Please turn down the 1115 Waiver proposal of the NC Department of Health and Human Services and support health being the actual caring for of people health!"
"NC Medicaid reform will not be truly transformative and innovative unless we
close the Coverage Gap so that low-wage working adults, children and families, and residents of rural
and underserved communities have access to quality health care. Multiple reports provide evidence that
Medicaid expansion addresses concerns such as bolstering the health care workforce, strengthening the
financial viability of safety net providers, and improving provider engagement. Most importantly, the
waiver states the need to improve community health, which is hard to achieve and sustain if 500,000
North Carolinians are left without health coverage. Please do the right thing for all North Carolinians' sake and expand Medicaid."
"I am a PA in rural NC. It is already difficult for us to adequately serve the families in our area. The waiver proposal will make it even more difficult for families, children especially, to access needed health services."

As a citizen and healthcare employee I cannot agree with this waiver. It will cut out children's healthcare as we see it today. The elderly will also suffer. Ones that have worked hard all their lives won't be able to receive medication that they depend on daily. I think there can be another way made to fix this problem like more careful spending and less abuse of funds. It will also cut lots of jobs in the healthcare community which will also be a hardship on family's.
"The attached comments are submitted by Dr. Jonathan Kotch, President, Health Care for All NC."
"Dear CMS Please see my attached. Timothy P. Bukowski, MD Raleigh, NC"
"Is it truly a good idea to allow for-profit organizations manage the care of a medically vulnerable population? I fear my Pediatric patients will be the big losers in this reform, and I fear what savings NC will make now will be passed along in significant costs as my patients become adults. This reform needs further thought."
I THINK THE MEDICAID GAP SHOULD BE CLOSE
"I am a pediatrician in North Carolina, and I do not support this waiver."
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
In 2014, 43% of all community health center patients in North Carolina were uninsured and more than 70% of patients lived at or below 100% FPL. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications.
With Medicaid expansion, community health centers in North Carolina could better coordinate the full spectrum of care their patients need. Medicaid expansion would also bring new income to the community health centers that would enable them to expand sites and services, hire new staff, and integrate and improve the care they provide."
"I am a community pediatrician and feel that eliminating CCNC would be detrimental to the health of our patients with Medicaid.I am concerned that with increasing the number of parties involved, it will reduce the quality of care provided and potentially the quantity of people receiving care. Anything that gets in the way of providing care to children with Medicaid- whether that be through reducing payment to providers, increasing complexity of providing care or limiting access to care- will only prove to have long term and short term negative affects to the health of children in NC."
"My father used to say, ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"". Community care of NC is a model for accessible , high quality and cost effective care. It is managed by North Carolinians for the people of North Carolina. Turning the management of Medicaid over to for-profit Prepaid Health plans will result in increased costs, decreased access, diminished quality of care, and undue burdens on the families of the children of North Carolina and the medical community that provides care for those children. Any program can be improved, but it's not necessary to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and that is just what this proposed waiver will do
Pediatrician, Eastern North Carolina"
Please expand medicaid so those most in need will have access to affordable healthcare.
"As a physician in a community health center, I have witnessed firsthand how difficult it can be for uninsured and low income individuals and families to receive the health care they need. This often leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which can have devastating health consequences for patients and ultimately increases health care costs to the system by causing more emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and advanced disease which could have been prevented.

This is the reason that I support Medicaid expansion in North Carolina. Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).

"Our 3 1/2 year old son Bryson suffers from a very rare brain disorder called Lissencephaly. His condition causes severe seizures, extreme development and cognitive delays among many other issues like feeding, reflux, and very low muscle tone. He is unable to sit unassisted and cannont crawl, walk or talk. He relies on my husband and I and his nurse care givers for all his activities of daily living. We could not make it without the help of his CAP-C medicaid that provides nursing care for him daily as well as home and vehicle modifications. Currently, we are in desperate need of modifying our bathroom to make it handcapp accessible for our son and are unable to do so because our funding has been put on hold. We have to put our severly disabled son in the bathtub with us which is very had to do. Please do not allow these benefits to be cut! Medciad reform should not be about cutting services to severly disabled children and their families who suffer on a daily basis. As parents our hearts break every day as we witness the hardships our son faces. There is nothing we can do to take his seizures away or to make him walk or talk. Please don't allow these proposed change and hurt our families even more. We work hard to make a living to pay our bills and make ends meet and still don't have the money to cover all of his needs. Also, please don't stop the NC Hipp program. We have an excellent health plan through BCBS through my husbands employer that covers the majority of all our sons medical care and saves Mediciad thousands of dollars a year. It only makes sense to help give hard working families who don't expect ""hand outs"" a break by covering the cost of having this very valuable health insurance. The cost of reimbursing our monthly health premiums is a fraction of the cost we are saving medicaid by having the coverage. If the NC Hipp program is eliminated we will be forced to drop the health coverage on our son and only use medicaid. We understand that medicaid reform is needed but not when it comes to our severly disabled babies. Do you have children? Look up Lissencephaly and put yourself in our shoes. How would you feel if it were your child going through what our son does on a daily basis. How would you feel if the services you rely on were drastically cut? Please have a heart and put a stop to these proposed changes. We are so very grateful for this program and could not make it without these very valuable services. Jane Peterson Ogle 828-674-0"

Medicaid must be expanded in North Carolina so that poor people will not go without health care. Expanding Medicaid will also help rural hospitals and small businesses.

"I am a pediatrician in an independent-not hospital owned- practice in Eastern NC where the poverty level approximates 25-30%. Over 70% of my patients received publicly funded medical insurance, either Medicaid or HealthChoice, our state CHIP plan. Our practice has been a decades long partner with Community Care of NC (CCNC) and that relationship has created opportunities for our practice to pilot new projects, places a nurse case manager in our office to coordinate medical care of our more complicated patients, and give us data and feedback on any changes that we make to improve the medical care that we deliver. Sweeping, overarching changes to the entire system will be complicated. If we must move to managed care, consider smaller pilot projects
through CCNC. Medicaid is 70% children and the huge majority 95% are relatively healthy. Please consider their continued health."
Lives and Jobs need Medicaid expansion.
"1. Expand medicaid coverage to cover all NC citizens and as a bonus, create significant jobs throughout the state.
2. Community Care of NC does an excellent job and should be retained.
3. The changes being recommended will cripple the provision of health care services in NC not help!"
"CMS,
Please deny this medicaid waiver. We have a great physician-led system currently in place that has served the Medicaid population well in the past few years. The current system, while not perfect, keeps physicians involved in working with the system to provide improved service to the children of North Carolina and to do so more efficiently. Multiple MCO's will only increase complexity and hinder our ability to continue to provide service to the Medicaid population. The current system is not broken so please do not allow this change."
"As a North Carolinian, registered voter, public health advocate, and taxpayer, I am disappointed with North Carolina's proposed plan to reform the Medicaid program. I believe the state has ignored NC citizens and communities and have gone forward with a proposal based on their own agendas. For the past three years, many North Carolinians have asked for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. States that have expanded Medicaid are states with better health outcomes. I want to live in a state that chooses better health outcomes. The state has done a poor job of providing options and addressing health inequity in NC communities, and Medicaid expansion would be a step in the right direction to improving our healthcare system. Please require the state to expand Medicaid if they want to move forward with this plan.

Also with this plan, as an HIV/AIDS health advocate and professional, I would like to see more funding put towards HIV case management. People living with HIV are shown to have better treatment adherence and more likely to achieve viral suppression. This reform also needs to require Medicaid/Medicare physicians to adopt routine HIV testing for preventive measures. Many primary care providers do not offer HIV testing as a routine examination and the CDC has recommended all people, ages 13-64 to be routinely tested no matter race, sex, or risk factor. This will decrease the amount of late stage diagnoses in NC (being diagnosed with AIDS within the first 12 months of initial HIV diagnosis and can lead to serious health complications or death) and also reduce stigma about HIV. Hepatitis C testing and treatment should also be made a priority in this reform.

This reform also needs to include a developed plan around substance use treatment with funding and quality measures that ensure quality treatment, that is harm reduction focused not abstinence based."

Please see attached file.
Low income unisured working adults in NC need access and deserve to have insurance coverage to meet their health care needs. Otherwise they don't have the funds to be seen by a doctor and their medical condition(s) go untreated. Every human being deserves the quality of good healthcare and to be healthy. Please have compassion for these folks and approve changes to the NC Medicaid program that allows them to have quality healthcare coverage. Thanks so kindly. Kbarfield
"I can already see issues with changing NC Medicaid with referrals being one of them.. Our practice is 70 % Medicaid and while we may sign up with certain plans, the specialists we refer to may not be signed up with the same plan leaving us to researching who can follow this patient and sending them long distances to find a specialist. This is a HUGE problem now with SC Medicaid as we see some of their patients."
"I am in full support of expanding Medicaid coverage, opening access to health care to the North Carolinians who fall in the gap between Medicaid eligibility and the insurance subsidies available through the Affordable Care Act."
"The failure of North Carolina to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act has impacted the citizens, our economy and health care system in a very negative ways. We have already lost 4 hospitals in rural areas and can expect more to close because of the lack of health care coverage for the poor in these rural areas. At least half a million people would be covered with the expansion of medicaid and many jobs would be added to our economy which is in need of good paying middle class jobs.
I AM ASKING CMS TO MAKE ANY APPROVAL OF THE NC MEDICAID REFORM WAVER APPLICATION CONDITIONAL ON THE STATE EXPANDING MEDICAID.

"From prior experience working with managed Medicaid care in Tennessee and the behavioral health LMEs in North Carolina, I ask that you seriously reconsider contracting the Medicaid program out to vendors. The result of managed Medicaid programs is a patchwork of billing rules, administrative processes, and credentialing paperwork that make it nearly impossible for providers to conduct business with Medicaid. Every contractor has different forms, different coding edits, different timely filing rules. Not to mention, contractors are unaccountable for the problems or inefficiencies in the program. Haven't we learned our lesson from NCTracks/CSC. They don't care about the people of North Carolina.

I can assure you that if you move forward with turning our Medicaid program into this managed care mess, providers will dis-enroll in droves. But, that's probably what you want because your only concern is saving money."
"In order for Medicaid patients to have assurances of access to care, there is a need for provisions to protect the providers. Eliminate burdens and obstacles that will make the doctors decide to stop seeing Medicaid. Keep the fee schedule no lower than Medicaid and require all the companies and PLE to use the same credentialing forms and standard."
I am 100% in favor of expanding Medicaid so that more North Carolinians can afford to seek out the medical care they need for themselves and their families.

"I am a pediatric provider and owner of an independent practice. Our practice currently accepts Medicaid with no restrictions, and we have found working with CCNC to be extremely helpful for some of our most challenging patients. Like most of my peers, I view caring for children as a calling and am committed to helping them regardless of their means. However, like many independent practices, we are truly struggling. My accountant tells me we have a ""bare bones"" budget. We have decreased staff over the last year-- as a small business owner and job provider, this pains me greatly. Despite this, our schedules are full and my colleagues and I routinely work at least 13 hour days. If Medicaid reform further cuts reimbursements to pediatric providers- who are already the lowest paid of all physician specialties and receive 70% of Medicare rates for Medicaid patient care-- it will further affect my staff and our ability to provide care. This is not just fear; this is fact. We do have information based on Medicaid privatization from other states, and the indications are that payments are delayed, and that the system does not work as well as what we have in place with CCNC. I would likely have to cap our percentage of Medicaid patients, which I am loathe to do. Please consider protecting the children of NC from a system that will not work as well as what we already have in place."

"I am a life long North Carolina resident from a transitioning rural county, a member of both the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood Votes South Atlantic and Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic, and the mother of two daughters. I am deeply concerned about the barriers women and families in my state face to receive quality medical care and the great need for access to quality family planning services, particularly among those receiving Medicaid. Any attempt to obtain a waiver of the current family planning free choice of provider protections ensuring that a patient can receive family planning services from any willing Medicaid-participating provider and ensuring that Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid provider is not wrongfully excluded from the program would result in harm to many of our most vulnerable residents. I ask that CMS explicitly clarify that Medicaid enrollees remain entitled to seek family planning services from any willing Medicaid provider and reaffirm that Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid-participating family planning provider is not excluded. It is also of concern that the waiver also does not specify that women may elect to have an obstetrical or gynecological (OB/GYN) provider as their primary care provider. OB/GYN providers, including women's health centers like Planned Parenthood, play a central role in the health care of women. Low-income women, in particular, tend to rely on reproductive health care providers as their primary (or only) source of care, or as pivotal entry points to the broader health care system and essential health care resources, such as behavioral health and social supports. Reproductive health providers, including PP, routinely fill the role of primary health care provider. In North Carolina, 54 percent of pregnancies are unintended. Reducing unintended pregnancy rates and improving birth outcomes avoid use of more intensive health care services, can reduce the need for long-term engagements in the health care system, and save money. Federal law explicitly entitles Medicaid enrollees to family planning services and family planning providers. It is critical and necessary under the law that CMS work with North Carolina to ensure that all Medicaid enrollees participating in PCHCs have timely access to all state-covered family planning services and supplies from the family planning provider of their choice.

Close the coverage gap.
"I see no need for this proposed Medicaid reform. There are changes that should be made but capitated prepaid health plans would not be a good one. According to the public notice the transformation and reorganization of NC Medicaid eligibility would not change except for parents of children in foster care. So nothing is really changing expect doctor's will be receiving less money which could turn into to some doctor's not accepting Medicaid. People are under the assumption that more people will be eligible for Medicaid which is not what I got from what has been presented. The reform should be making sure Medicaid is used appropriately with how it is used now. I previously worked for an Emergency Department and patient's with Medicaid will utilize the ED before going to their primary care doctor for a cold. That is abusing federal dollars. So capping what it paid to doctor's is not the solution. The solution would be to educate patient on the healthcare system. Teach them how to utilize primary care doctors versus using the Emergency Department and the benefits of it. This reform is a cop out and shows the laziness of DHHS. Are changes needed..yes! Is this reform the change we need? No!!!! I do not support this waiver and recommended changes…. 90% of pediatricians currently accept medicaid in NC, which pays 75% medicare rates. Further reduction in reimbursement, which will likely happen, to rates 50-60% of what private payers currently pay would lead to pediatricians not accepting medicaid, and lead to a lack of access of patients who will get their care at emergency rooms, driving up the cost of healthcare overall. CCNC in NC has improved tremendously care being delivered in the medical home, not in Emergency or urgent care environments, saving the system money."
"currently work for a pediatric provider in Southeastern NC. Working in coordination with Community Care of NC, we have reduced ER visits, improved care coordination, and reduce costs by managing referrals to more expensive specialists. Our current collaboration with CCNC is very efficient for physicians, staff and patients. Completely overhauling a successful system seems ridiculous. Therefore, I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver for NC."
"The Medicaid waiver included in Governor McCrory's Medicaid Reform plan is not feasible. As an employee in a pediatric office that consists of 76% Medicaid patients, I directly see how these proposed changes negatively affect our patients. Medicaid reform will not work if it does not directly help those who utilize the services. The CCNC program has done a great job at helping the citizens of North Carolina and the Medicaid reform would un-do the positive advances that this program has made. It is our job, as a state, to make provisions for the health of our children and these proposed changes add nothing but more barriers in ability to access the level of healthcare that our children need. I cannot support a reform to Medicaid that ignores so many vital components that the citizens of North Carolina need."
"I do not see how the proposed changes will help children get the care they need. Overhauling a system that has included so many advancements, such as CCNC, is costly and unnecessary. The proposed changes to the Medicaid will make things more difficult. Living in a poor, rural county with a high percentage of children receiving public insurance through Medicaid, I can distinctly see how this reform will continue to make things harder on them. The addition of separate regions, PHPs, and increased amount of administrative burden will force these children to go without the medical care they need. Specifically for children needing advanced care, the Medicaid Waiver process would make that virtually impossible. Because of the nightmare Medicaid would become, I refuse to support the proposed reform."
The expansion of Medicaid is not only essential to public health but also fiscally responsible.
"I work in pediatrics every day. In fact, in my office, 3 out of every 4 of our patients receive Medicaid. A change to the Medicaid program directly correlates to a reduction in adequate care for our patients. In continuation, it directly affects my job. I do not see how North Carolina can propose this reform to Medicaid and expect it to help those it directly affects. Not only will it create such a burden on the practice at the administrative level, it will also cause a greater burden on the families receiving Medicaid benefits. A change to the Medicaid program is a negative change for North Carolina."
I am a FNP in North Carolina and I am opposed to the waiver. The current system with CCNC has served North Carolina pediatric Medicaid patients very well and the current proposal will destroy the trust and relationships that we have worked hard to build. Having read to proposal and gone to a comment session I have found no pediatrician that thinks this will be good for their patients or their practice. Please say no to the waiver
"The expansion of Medicaid is not only essential to public health but also fiscally responsible. It will help support rural hospitals, reduce crime, bring jobs and revenue to counties, and provide desperately needed care to our veterans and their spouses. Please review the attached supporting documents.

"I work have been working with low income patients for the last 8yrs and have worked as a Outreach coordinator for the last 3 yrs. enrolling patients into the Affordable Care Act market Place, we have done so much good for the consumers that did qualify for the program but we also have a lot of consumers that did not qualify and it is very heartbreaking because this are the people that need it the most, it would be great if Medicaid would be expanded in our state, it would be so beneficial in keeping America Healthy."

"I am the HR Director at a pediatric office that is currently in 3 counties in SE NC. Our corporation is 78% medicaid. I am very concerned about the proposed waiver having up to 15 different PHPs as well as breaking the state into sections. If this is accomplished under the waiver, the administrative costs and burden will increase dramatically for the practices. It will be extremely difficult and time-consuming for practices to dispute claims, affecting cash flow to a great extent. I am opposed to the current waiver and hope that CMS will not approve it."
I work at a pediatric office in NC and I do not support this change. Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid program.
"I currently am employed at a pediatric office in Robeson County, one of the poorest counties in NC. I cannot support the waiver because I feel it will affect the access to care for the patient. We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable patients that have parents that do not understand the healthcare system, and this waiver will further complicate the system."
"I am a pediatrician working at Jacksonville childrens clinic, in Jacksonville. The Medicaid reform would make it hard for the Pediatric clinics to survive and continue helping the patients. I do not support this change."

"As a North Carolinian and the mother of a disabled child, I want to voice my concerns about the Medicaid reform plans. First, the plan is unclear and full of confusing rules. Medicaid recipients and families already struggle with mountains of paperwork and rules in addition to the level of care required in their homes. Our time is precious and scarce. My husband and I both work full time in addition to caring for our son. We are not professional medical billing/insurance workers and dealing with the legal paperwork takes a lot of time that we would rather spend with our child. It is wrong to impose undue burdens. Secondly, the model of proposed regions is a bad idea. Many disabled people require special levels of care and just the right providers. Limiting the disabled to care in a region is counterproductive to their care and could, in some cases, be deadly. I also find this rule discriminatory. People who have private or employer-sponsored insurance in addition to Medicaid would have a greater ability to seek care across regions. This would create different classes of recipients with drastically different access to proper care. Thirdly, the possible cancellation of NC HIPP is a bad idea for both families and taxpayers. For families, this helps to offset employer-sponsored insurance premiums in households that are already spending money on care in many ways that typical households do not, for example in inflated utility costs. For taxpayers, this helps to limit the burden on the Medicaid program by keeping people on employer-sponsored insurance as their first level of claims. These proposed plans are deeply problematic and do not seem to have the best interest of recipients as their focus. As a voter, I ask you to consider these policies with the best interests of the recipients and the state in mind and to understand that these policies deeply affect our day to day lives and the care and accommodations that we can provide for our
children.

"As a practice administrator in pediatrics for 24 years, I think the biggest problem I have with the waiver is lack of understanding. None of my questions about the actual workings of Medicaid managed care have been clearly explained. The politicians they sent around to answer questions were clueless. It would really help to have more information on how the process will work if it has to happen."
I hope that Medicaid Expansion will happen in NC. It is not economically sound nor morally acceptable to turn down health care for our citizens who make too little money to qualify for Medicaid and too much money to qualify for Medicaid with its current income requirement. Using the hospital's E.R.s for health care does NOT save money for tax payers and is financially ruining hospitals and clinics.

"My name is Beverly Edwards, and I am a pediatrician born, raised and educated through medical school here in North Carolina. I have been in general pediatric practice in Ahoskie, NC as the sole owner of Ahoskie Pediatrics for the last 25yrs. I have adhered to the mission of my Medical school, ECU,by proving primary care in a rural setting.

My practice here flourished, and I am proud to say we have had one of the highest vaccination rates in the state and that we have been trusted to c

are for our county's foster children and that we have been able to coordinate the care of complex patients with specialists across

North Carolina and Virginia.

Starting in 2013, my practice began to feel the sting of our state not adopting the ACA as mandated. We put a lot of money into being sure we attested and did receive the federal money for that effort. We did not get the Medicaid rate increase to Medicare standards until mid-2014. By then we were financially embarrassed and never sure that we'd received appropriate reparations. The rate decrease to former Medicaid rates in 2015 sped up our financial decline. Now, in 2016, my practice has been pared down by one NP, two full-time nurses
and less hours for our part time support staff.
I hang on, because in addition to my own children,who are getting their higher education, I have over 2000 babies, children and adolescents to provide medical care for, 70-80% are Medicaid patients. I have not and will not refuse to take new Medicaid patients.
I appreciate the help I've been given by Brody School of Medicine, Vidant Hospital System, the NC Pediatric Society and the NC Peds Council. I would not have been able to keep my practice open thus far without them. CCNC has played a very valuable role in our practice: we serve four counties and awesome outreach is available to our patients. Whether in Hertford, Bertie, Gates or Northampton County, our patients are keeping their appointments with our office or their specialists, having their medicines reviewed regularly for compliance and generally staying healthier. CCNC is not broken! It really works in the rural areas.
Thank you for any time and attention you give my remarks ."

"Other states have experimented with reforms similar to the one NC is proposing, which gives the state legislature a chance to prove to the public that the proposed reforms will work. As a concerned citizen, I need *clear evidence* that these changes to Medicaid will be effective. Despite occasional cost overruns, it is widely known that the current Medicaid system in NC is exceptionally well run and efficient. If the state legislature wants changes, it needs to provide clear reasons why."
"I am a mental health services researcher and have a long history studying mental health care and mental health reform in North Carolina since completing my PhD at NCSU in 1987. I am for the expansion of Medicaid as it will increase access to mental health care as well as primary health care for so many people. Expanding access to mental health care is especially critical. However, I am AGAINST the current plan which proposed to move Medicaid to managed care plans and continues the current preference for privatization of vital services. I think we have enough evidence from the past 10 years of mental health care reform and privatization that the private sector DOES NOT provide adequate care. The incentives are to manage the costs, and not manage the care. There are some exceptions of course (for example Cardinal seems to do a reasonable job), but by and by, any plan which allows for profit by private companies has strong incentives to minimize care and offer short term solutions to complex, long term problems."
North Carolina must expand Medicaid to include those who are not covered by the ACA but for whom the ACA determines coverage. Please include Medicaid expansion in North Carolina in any approved reform.
"I would like to add that a recent article outlines participation rates of urologists in Medicaid. The best participation rates 80-100% correlate with states that do not use MCO's to manage Medicaid, and the lowest rates correlate with states that have broad MCO coverage. DHHS has already highlighted the problem that North Carolina already has poor urological coverage throughout rural parts of the state, and I expect this would worsen with low participation rates due to MCO management, as is shown in the article by Overholser et. al, in Journal of Urology Practice, vol.3, 276-282, July 2016. From this point of view, it does not make sense to transition to MCO management."
"I consider it essential that the state facilitate affordable access to health care to the low-income North Carolinians who fall in the gap between Medicaid eligibility and the insurance subsidies available through the Affordable Care Act. What justifies Medicaid expansion above all is that it would be an invaluable investment in the general wellbeing of the state and all of its citizens.

Almost half a million people fall in the gap, which means that either they don't seek care when they should or they turn to emergency rooms. Both options involve costs that it would be shortsighted for the state to ignore. Delayed treatment results in more expensive medical care for the affected individual; if he or she is employed, it results in reduced productivity and absenteeism; and if he or she has a family, it can place greater financial and psychological stress on the home. The emergency-room option results in unreimbursed costs to a medical system already overburdened, and it turns resources away from the emergencies that ERs are meant to handle.

One-fourth of the people who fall in the gap are children. It benefits no one in the state—from the poorest person to the wealthiest—to leave children with medical problems untreated. Children with treatable diseases and physical injuries who are not provided care may well become an ever-greater burden on society as they make their way toward adulthood. And children in this situation may find their lives turned into a misery from which they cannot recover. That outcome cannot be warranted by any meaningful social ethos."



"I have been a pediatrician in eastern NC for over 15 years and have had the privilege of watching care improve as our Medicaid system has improved. The current Medicaid system in NC, Community Care of NC, is excellent at meeting the dual needs of limiting costs, providing access and providing excellent care to the neediest citizens on our state. I am writing to strongly advise that this requested waiver NOT be approved. Our current system works and is solidly in place. The proposed change over to private entities does NOT make sense and will be costly and disruptive. Anyone knowledgeable about the current system believes in its effectiveness and value. As a physician committed to saving cost in health care and providing quality care-- I strongly advise the request for a waiver be denied."
"I am responding to the North Carolina proposed 1115 Medicaid waiver. I am a full-time practicing pediatrician in Raleigh, NC. I am concerned that the proposed fundamental change to Medicaid will bring unnecessary and unwanted added bureaucracy to a system that in its current state has shown over the past 5 years consistent improvements in care while lowering the overall per member cost. Community Care of NC (CCNC), as the management organization for Medicaid, has proven itself to be able to lower costs while providing improvement in health outcomes. CCNC is touted nationwide as a model for how to manage care. To eliminate this organization and replace it with multiple competing organizations make no sense to most of us practicing pediatricians.
Practicing pediatricians lean heavily on CCNC for its expertise. They are keenly aware of the special services many of our patients need to stay in good health and develop as well as possible. We have a real fear that private insurance company managers are not going to have that expertise making the authorization for needed services or tests much more difficult to obtain. We fear that this will add cost and time to us and our staff. This will be even more cumbersome if we have to deal with a number of managed care companies.
Most of us who care for special needs children, that is children with complex medical problems, feel a genuine need to help these children who deserve the best care they can get. The reality is that we also need to receive adequate pay for our time and services. Under the proposal, it is likely that we will get less pay for even more time that will be needed to be invested on our patients' behalf.
To abandon the system we have in North Carolina, and replace it with a much more cumbersome one simply does not make sense. Keeping the important work of a model system such as CCNC and actually expanding Medicaid would do much more to improve health care and health outcomes for the children of North Carolina.
Robert L. Munt, Jr., MD"

I work in a pediatrics office as a clinical support coordinator. I am responsible for prior authorizations for medications as well as procedures. If NC Medicaid becomes 15 entities that would be a nightmare for me and many other departments in our office. Please consider the effect this will have on all pediatric patients who often need special medications and procedures.
Please see the attached letter.

"Uninsured North Carolinians who are less healthy raise families who are less healthy. The burden of care (for the uninsured) falls in various ways and places throughout North Carolina communities, but this burden falls exponentially throughout the state in schools, clinics, hospitals, and worksites. Local and county clinics provide care for people who would be in better health, and require much less critical, complicated care had they only been receiving regular, comprehensive care through routine visits to health care providers. Illness spreads through public schools because children don't have access to primary care medicine to easily diagnose and treat common illness. Hospitals and clinics close because they can't turn critically ill people away, yet their margins can't absorb high costs of their care. Premiums of the already insured rise to cover costs absorbed by the system. Regardless of the position one takes on health care being a right or a privilege, surely common sense dictates that it's more logical (not to mention more humane!) for people to have guaranteed access to primary care. As a state and as a society, we pay upstream, or we pay downstream. And downstream, when we're paying to address problems compounded by effects of longterm poor health and untreated illness, is far more expensive. The costs of NOT expanding Medicaid are tremendous; they have ripple effects throughout our state. Expand Medicaid because it the right thing to do, and because it is the logical thing to do. Expanding access to Medicaid ensures that ALL North Carolina taxpayers will benefit from living among a healthier population. Healthier North Carolinians can focus on living productive lives that will move our state ever forward."

"UNFUNDED MANDATES
Comments with respect to the North Carolina Medicaid and NC Health Choice Draft Section 1115 Waiver Application
Disclaimer, I am both a provider of I/DD services (for twenty (20) years) and currently provide services through the NC Innovations Waiver and a I am the father of a 24 year old man with Autism who receives services through this waiver.
North Carolina I/DD providers have not received a Medicaid rate increase since 2001 (the exception being State institutions and ICFs). By not performing annual cost findings and adjusting Medicaid rates accordingly, the State has not issued rate increases annually for the last fifteen (15) years. During this period, the State has mandated over seventeen (17) mandates (national accreditation, malpractice insurance, additional clinical tasks, etc.) that have increased our operational costs by approximately 30%.
To pay for these unfunded mandates, providers are unable to pay their employees who actually work one-on-one with our disabled clients a livable wage. North Carolina I/DD Providers pay is less that what we were paying in 2001.
Before North Carolina needs to conduct a cost finding analysis of her provider network to assure we are either compensated for these mandates or the mandate is removed to enable us to pay the people doing the hands on service are paid a wage that matches the skills and abilities required for this service delivery.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment."

"The biggest concern I have with the proposed reform is eliminating NCHIPP. I have a medically fragile 1 year old that receives private insurance and Medicaid. In her first year of life her private insurance paid out over $1 million in claims before Medicaid was ever billed. NCHIPP reimburses our family for the insurance premiums which saves our family a great deal of money and without the program, we would not be able to insure our child. Thus that would increase the claims submitted to Medicaid.

Our other concern is cresting districts to receive Medicaid services. At this point our daughter receives her cate in our props ed territory. However with her condition we have considered seeking second opinions elsewhere in the state and possibly changing her specialist care. With this proposed plan we would be unable to do so."

"It is incredibly difficult to get practices and providers enrolled, contracted, and paid by the Behavioral Health contractors. Until this is addressed, this effort will not be successful"

"NC should expand Medicaid. Many NC citizens would be helped particularly children. While the economy has improved for some, many have stagnating wages, with an added burden of a family member with physical or behavioral problems it makes getting the needed treatment very difficult. Please expand Medicaid.
Thank you,
Sincerely, Linda Graney"
"To Whom it May Concern,

I am a private practice pediatrician who currently has the honor and privilege of serving patients primarily from Alamance and Orange counties in North Carolina. Our practice is the largest provider of pediatric primary care in a service area of around a quarter of a million people, and around a third or more of the children and youths we see in our practice are insured through our state Medicaid program.

Having been with my practice for a little over a year now, I happily found that my efforts to advocate for the health care needs of our Medicaid patients were very well supported by our local Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) network. This support was something I had been able to rely on during my previous work as a pediatric resident and fellow in Durham County. The work that CCNC does with patients supplements what our patients, their families, and us in the provider community are able to accomplish within the walls of the clinic, by providing follow-up, education, and coordination of care to which they likely would not otherwise have access.

However, I am fearful that the community-based, provider-led, and ground-level CCNC networks that to date have served our most vulnerable children and youths in the Medicaid population will be demolished and replaced by an ineffective, fragmented, and top-down approach to community health upon the approval of this waiver in its current form. Not only that, the waiver in its current form will lead to a restriction in access to care, dissatisfaction and increased administrative burden to providers, and a dismantling of a system that has been shown by the data to create a downwards pressure on the cost curve for the general Medicaid population.

...PLEASE SEE FULL COMMENTS IN ATTACHED DOCUMENT."
"Yes, please expand Medicaid to cover the insurance gap left between the Affordable Healthcare Act and the ability to pay private insurance. I know far too many people who are affected by this gap, most of which are the ones that need healthcare coverage the most"
"Having been in healthcare for 23 years, it baffles me how anyone can think the Medicaid waiver proposal will improve a system that is currently a nationally recognized, award winning system that actually works. CCNC has been a national example of an organization that works well with both physician and patient for care and lower cost. As a manager of a large pediatric practice with over 20,000 Medicaid lives, I can speak from first hand experience, that the current system works and works extremely well. It has 100% physician buy-in, which is a essential for any system to succeed. The proposed waiver is such a bureaucratic mess that it will be impossible for patients to understand the new system. At hearings and via comment, there has been nearly 99% disapproval of the system proposed in the waiver. The Medicaid population, due to socio economic concerns, is in general a higher risk, lower educated patient pool with many barriers to care already. Those who wrote this waiver obviously rarely see their own doctor, let alone understand the barriers they are creating for this patient pool to receive care. As a medicaid patient, why figure out this mess? Just go to the ER. We hear that they'll have patient counselors to call the patients and advise them of their options? Really? In a system where addresses and phone numbers change monthly, they expect to identify and help these people? They expect that Big Brother insurance company no where near NC, taking profits from NC, will go the extra mile to help this population? The red tape alone will make things impossible for the patients as well as the physicians to provider care.

CCNC's partnership with DME works!!! It's at the grass roots level, in our practices, in our communities, providing care, helping people in a way that proposed plan can't. The politicians want to be able to sell a system and claim an accomplishment. If our current system, with CCNC and DME working hand in hand goes away, you won't be able to bring it back. You can't recreate 30 years of effort by DME and pediatricians to create one of the best systems in the county. Please don't loose sight of the goal, which is to provide quality, cost effective care. To have healthy adults, you must have healthy children!!! The 1115 will guarantee a failure in cost and care and to this population for YEARS!!!

"I'm against this waiver. I have moved from Mississippi and there were several insurance companies providing medicaid coverage.
It was extremely difficult to keep up with each individual company's formulary. It was defintley a barrier to providing good patient care."
"As a rural family physician in North Carolina I have four serious concerns about the North Carolina Medicaid Reform proposal.

1) Dismantling the nationally recognized Community Care of North Carolina in favor of for profit insurance companies will increase costs for services, decrease provider reimbursement, and increase the complexity of filing Medicaid claims. I believe that these factors will further limit the number of physicians who do not cap the percentage of their patients who are on Medicaid.

2) There is no plan to expand Medicaid coverage for the working poor who do not qualify for the insurance exchanges.

3) There are multiple references to telemedicine as a means of improving access to care however the waiver does not clearly support parity in reimbursement for care provided via telemedicine. Additionally, under current NC Medicaid policy, RHCs and FQHCs cannot be the distant site in a telemedicine encounter and changing this is not addressed in the waiver. If this change is not made we will not be able to see the full potential of telemedicine/telehealth in our state.

4) One of the essential tenets of school-based health centers is that all students are able to be seen regardless of their ability to pay. When I made the recommendation that SBHCs be recognized as essential providers during the listening sessions it si due to my concern that all of the new Medicaid insurers will not include all SBHCs in their contracts. Therefore, while the SBHC will continue to see all students, they may not receive reimbursement from all Medicaid insurers and therefore their ability to be self sustaining will decrease."
"I have copied and pasted the conclusion to a report on the situation regarding Medicaid. Nothing in the proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration will provide healthcare for 500,000 NC citizens who currently lack medical insurance and, thereby, adequate healthcare. And, in fact, this proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstratio will limit healthcare to those fortunate NC citizens who now have Medicaid by rationing the healthcare available to them now. In the interest of making an honest effort to improve healthcare in NC, please reconsider the proposed Medicaid Reform Demonstration.

"" the Quadruple Aim and initiatives outlined in the 1115 waiver application are commendable, failing to expand Medicaid will prevent NC DHHS from achieving its goals. North Carolina lawmakers and NC DHHS are ignoring that NC Medicaid reform will not be truly transformative and innovative unless we close the Coverage Gap so that low-wage working adults, children and families, and residents of rural and underserved communities have access to quality health care. Multiple reports provide evidence that Medicaid expansion addresses concerns such as bolstering the health care workforce, strengthening the nancial viability of safety net providers, and improving provider engagement. Most importantly, the waiver states the need to improve community health, which is hard to achieve and sustain if 500,000 North Carolinians are le without health coverage.

Thank you,
Cynthia Johnson"
"NC already has a model recognized across the nation that provides Managed Medicaid services via a pubic private entity known as Community Care NC. It has performed remarkably well and thus does not need fixing,

Since the NC Legislature & Governor have refused any serious consideration of Medicaid expansion, we have a coverage gap of up to 500,000 North Carolinians eligible for Medicaid under ACA.

I wholeheartedly support the integration of behavioral health into primary care/medical homes but to get there, we will have to hold a lot of feet to the fire.

Brenda Cleary, RN, PhD"
"I am a Pediatrician in Western NC. DO NOT APPROVE THE WAIVER. PLEASE DO NOT RUIN THE EXISTING MEDICAID SYSTEM, AND THE ACCESS CARE PROGRAM. .North Carolina has had a long history of having an excellent Medicaid program. It has been very cost-effective, and is envied by many states throughout the country. The Medicaid program on the pediatric side, has partnered together to drastically improve cost-effectiveness of Medicaid for pediatric patient care. I was one of the first Pediatricians in a pilot program as part of Access Care.

When we first put this group together, consisting of nine and then later 12 pediatric practices, we had unblinded results in 12 or 14 different areas showing comparative cost. We all helped each other out so that those with higher cost s were mentored by those who had lower-cost, those that had better results would help those who had less favorable clinical results. It was a team to work together to try to reduce the costs, and increased the quality of care for these Medicaid patients. And it worked.

This makes no sense to me to throw out all of the good work we did for years to lower the cost of care.

DO THE RIGHT THING AND KEEP OUR ONE PAYER MEDICAID SYSTEM."
"In a small county, I am concerned when I see 15 physicians leave medicine, with no replacements, the writing is on the wall. One third of all physicians are 60 now, and we want to get out as soon as possible, and the prospects of replacements are limited. We cannot continue to lose pediatricians who care for our patients. Reversing many decades of the opposite findings, in 2012, a large independent nonpartisan survey had shown that 90% of physicians were advising their children not to go into medicine. With further changes in healthcare, and attitudes over the past four years this has only worsened, and very few physicians recommend their children go into medicine. That says a lot.

Years ago I attended a Pediatric Meeting in Gatlinburg, and discovered there were no pediatricians left in that 5 county area. The ""TennCare"" fiasco had driven them out - they left the State.

In recent years, Connecticut fired their MCOs and went back to saving money with their State managing their fee-for-service Medicaid, with a model similar to CCNC! And yet we are about to replicate the Tennessee fiasco I described, and abandon our existing Medicaid program to create a system that Connecticut found was more costly!

In an attempt to reduce bureaucracy, what is being proposed will exponentially increase the bureaucratic nightmare and waste.

Do we really want to do this in NC ??

The medical home providers are the foundation for pediatric care, and are being financially squeezed out.

Thank you to DHHS for all of your hard work over the years on behalf of the children in our State.
Dr. David Millsaps"
"Here is the view from Pediatrics: The grim reality is that we have to be financially solvent to assure access to quality healthcare. The ACA Medicare parity payments ended in December of 2014, and the Meaningful use incentive funds end soon, leaving us with a significant loss, approaching 30% cut in revenues. Overhead has significantly increased. ADDING THE INCREASED BURDEN OF 9-12 MEDICAID CONTRACTS WILL ADD FURTHER TO OUR OVERHEAD COSTS!

Do we get rid of our triage nurses and just tell ALL patients to come in if they are sick or have a question - less overhead costs, more office visit revenue, but more costs to the Medicaid system!

Do we close on weekends and send 40-50 patients per weekend to the ERs at 5 to 10 times the cost compared to the office?

Do we limit the number of complicated Medicaid patients that take more time? Who will take care of the complex children? ERs?

Do we limit the number or completely stop seeing Medicaid patients?

Or do we just close the practice entirely, which is what many pediatricians have done.

All of these situations are untenable. As you can see - we are worried!!

We need, at a minimum, a payment floor of the higher CPT code reimbursement rate of parity with Medicare, or the Medicaid fee schedule. There are just a few codes where Medicaid is higher.

DO NOT INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WITH MULTIPLE CARRIERS ADMINISTERING MEDICAID. INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENTS TO PARITY WITH MEDICARE TO ALLOW PRACTICES TO REMAIN SOLVENT AND RENDER QUALITY MEDICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. THE MEDICAL HOME KNOWS THE PATIENTS, DO NOT SEND THEM TO THE ERs AND URGENT CARES."
Why would any thinking person want to change a system which has seen decreasing per patient costs over the past 6 years?
Medicaid reform will NOT work if it does not work for children and for the medical professionals who take care of them. Our job is hard enough. Please do not complicate it and tie our hands.
"WHY should something be changed when a system is showing savings, AND you can NOT find PHYSICIANS who are CURRENTLY CARING FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR STATE who think it is a good idea to change the system! STOP and CONSIDER REASON. I was reviewing paperwork and came across this graph. THIS IS IMPRESSIVE - PLEASE REVIEW! Here is a snapshot of 2010- projected 2016 showing a ~30% decrease in cost per eligible recipient: WHY SHOULD WE TURN EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN IF WE CAN SHOW OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING????? Please see attached graph. Thank you, Susan Huffman Unifour Pediatrics, Hickory, NC"
"We in Catawba county are in the Unifour Area, which is made up of the following counties: Catawba, Burke, Caldwell and Alexander. The Unifour area is split into two proposed regions, and then we routinely refer patients to physicians in the Winston area, which adds a third region to manage.

This system is going to increase our costs tremendously. In a year or two after this is set up and implemented, we all will be thinking and saying"" ""won't we save a lot of money with centralized billing, fees and contracts, think of all of the administrative costs we will save for practices and for the State"".

Let's think ahead!!

The proposed system will cause undue administrative costs to the practices and inefficiencies will abound for practices and the State. We will need to hire additional staff to assist with administration of all of the complex contracts, and with the multiple regions, that means many more contracts.

Primary care Pediatric practices are financially fragile. We must have parity with Medicare, or the highest per CPT of Medicare or Medicaid fee schedules - there are a very few codes where Medicaid is paid more. We take care of patients 7 days a week, to keep children out of Urgent cares and ERs. It is the right thing to do, and it is quality care for our patients. If we cannot afford to see patients on weekend hours due to low reimbursements, financial decisions rather than quality decisions will have to rule, and we will have to stop weekend clinics and send our patients to the more expensive urgent cares and ERs.
We have many complex patients in our practice. With prepaid plans, there will be an incentive to have the least complex patients as a part of your patient population. Who will care for our complex children? How often will the acuity level of the practice be analyzed? With newborns joining our practice daily, we add very complex children. Should the acuity level and proposed PMPM follow the complex patient? How will this be decided? Don't make it an incentive for practices to dump the patients that are more complex and take much more time to see than ""normal"" patients.

We care for each child like they are our own. Will others?

If this reform goes through, you will witness a devastation of primary care practices. The medical home will not survive. You will be destroying the collaborative system that is in place between practices with Access Care and CCNC.

"As a private pediatrician in North Carolina I have very pleased with the current Medicaid system. When finishing residency I had the opportunity to work in Tennessee. Due to their managed care system, and the trouble physicians experienced, I chose to stay in North Carolina. A major change to our current Medicaid system would put undo burden on our small practice. We would not be able to add additional staff to manage multiple payers. We love all our patients and would hate to turn them away because of insurance reasons. I became a pediatrician to help children in eastern North Carolina please do not take away that opportunity by approving this waiver."
"Do not let this happen to a program that is a model for many states! Do you realize how many people in other states comment about the impressive Medicaid system and physician/State collaborative that is currently in place in NC?

Do not approve this waiver. It will limit access to patient care with multiple regions for one practice, difficulty to make referrals to specialists in other regions, difficulty to keep continuity of care with specialists for patients since birth. It will increase practice expenses to manage the administrative burden of sorting through patient care rules of prior auth, formularies, fee schedules, filing claims, working denials, and trying to find a representative to answer questions for multiple carriers administering the Medicaid contracts..

We should take a step back and look around!

For many years, Pediatrics has been working through the efficiencies and benchmarks to make us run the leanest possible for patient care costs. There isn't more to incentivize to gain lower operational costs. It is unfortunate that those decision makers do not see this.

Maybe pediatrics (0-21) should be carved out of the multiple managed care plans.

How can the decision makers not understand that this is a ridiculously expensive mistake?

The present program works well. Would be a mistake to change things.
"North Carolina's Medicaid reform plan lacks the most important change needed to improve health care for North Carolinians and strengthen the provider community — Medicaid expansion! Medicaid coverage should be extended to all adults ages 18-64 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In North Carolina, expanded Medicaid would cover more than 400,000 people; at least 244,000 of those in the Coverage Gap are uninsured as a result.
As a former employee in a local health department and a community health center, I have spent 37 years working in public health in NC. I have seen the benefits of Medicaid to many, mainly pregnant women and children. I also worked as a certified application counselor for the Affordable Care Act during the first two years of its inception. I saw how that also benefited even more people but I also saw the heartache and despair when I had to tell people that they were too poor to benefit from these programs because NC chose not to expand Medicaid. Community health center staff see firsthand the significant health challenges and barriers to needed services that these uninsured and low-income patients face. In North Carolina, nearly 40,000 women are not receiving recommended preventive screenings, 27,044 diabetics cannot get much needed medications, and 45,500 individuals with depression are not getting the treatment they need. In fact, providers often have to modify treatment plans for uninsured patients because of their inability to afford a specialist visit or pay for needed medications. This is not the type of health care these residents deserve.
Don't let North Carolina's Medicaid program leaving out the most important change for our state's health. We need North Carolina to expand Medicaid!
NC does not need to privatize Medicaid--this state has an excellent care management program in the Community Care of NC. This program started as a pilot in Cabarrus County (the county in which I worked) and was so effective, it was extended to the rest of the state. Other states would visit NC to see how well this program worked at improving the health of its participants while decreasing costs. Other states would then model this program when they returned to their respective state. Instead of continuing and expanding this program, the State wants to throw it out and start with a private physicians and insurance companies who have not shown any success in this area.
I would recommend against accepting this proposed"
"We have great relationships with our CCNC imbedded nurse manager. She assists our practitioners and our patients at an early point when a problem is discovered, difficulty in the patient making their specialist visits, or assisting parents with compliance to care plans.

Our billing staff can pick up the phone and talk with the our DMA regional consultant to discuss proper billing needed to obtain reimbursement by following the billing guidelines. If this is passed, there will be a roster of representatives to call.

It will be a nightmare if our one system is replaced with 5 to 15 insurance contracts.

We are adding complexity, and layers of red tape.

Keep it Simple!

"I am honored to serve as the medical director of a community health center in North Carolina. I see firsthand the burden experienced by people too poor to qualify for government-subsidized insurance from the ACA marketplace. Though our state's community health centers provide a wonderful primary care safety net for those fortunate to live in proximity to these centers, many of those we serve can't afford even the discounted medications available to them at our center, and they often do without. And when services beyond primary care are required, when people need specialty medical and surgical care, this can be very difficult, if not impossible to obtain for those of low income and lacking insurance. For the benefit of all in our communities, North Carolina should be required to make Medicaid expansion a centerpiece of healthcare reform, as wisely envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, I am concerned about the emphasis in the NC proposal on having for-profit companies compete for the state's Medicaid contracts. NC is fortunate to have in Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) a statewide, non-profit care management organization that has engaged and supported local practitioners in providing high quality, cost effective care to North Carolinians covered by Medicaid. CCNC has gained national recognition (most recently including the Hearst Health Prize) for its innovation, promotion of best practices to drive quality health outcomes, sophisticated utilization review and management, and cost savings. It is inconceivable to me that the NC Medicaid reform plan would not accord an essential and central role to this locally developed and managed organization which has a proven track record for serving so well the interests of NC Medicaid consumers and providers."
"""NO""
It is a simple word. Easy to say, easy to write. Yet if applied to the NC Medicaid Waiver, those two little letters will save the country's most inovative and successful Medicaid Program!
And, it will demonstrate to the rest of the country that CMS is not afraid to tell a state what they can and cannot do with Federal Healthcare dollars! Do not approve the 1115 Waiver just as a way of funneling money back to hospitals for uncompensated care - if the State wants that money they should expand Medicaid! Pediatric Healthcare will fall apart if the waiver is approved! Please do not sacrifice the children so the legislature will not have to expand Medicaid. Approving this waiver will reward bad behavior with irresponsible CMS behavior!

"To whom it may concern,

Having practiced Radiology in North Carolina for thirty four years, I am writing to request that the current Medicaid Reform Plan be rejected as it is incomplete and limited in scope by not including Medicaid expansion thereby excluding 300 -500,00 of it's citizens from needed and in many cases life saving care. I have personally seen the emotional and monetary consequences of late diagnosis of cancer and chronic diseases such as heart and diabetes due to lack to accessibility to health care including access to potentially life saving imaging procedures. A health care plan which potentially excludes up to one half million of it's most vulnerable citizens should not be allowed to stand.

Thank you for your consideration,

Cheryl A. Viglione, M.D."
"I am a Pediatrician who has served Medicaid patients in the Triangle area for over 20 years.
The proposed NC Medicaid Reform does not meet the basic criteria for a 1115 waiver, because is does not increase or improve the access or quality of medical care currently provided to our NC Medicaid population.
The proposed plan should be rejected."
"I am a health services researcher who has surveyed N.C. Medicaid populations since 1996 to determine access, satisfaction, & utilization of health care. Since about 1999 my research team used the CAHPS instruments. From 1996 until about 2000 NC Medicaid ran a pilot project in Mecklenburg County where fully capitated HMOs (no different from the managed care ""plans,"" proposed in the current waiver). Our research team did careful work comparing cost increases in Mecklenburg country with cost increases in New Hanover County in the far eastern part of the state & the second most densely populated country where traditional unmanaged Medicaid still existed. (That plan is a far cry from the current Medicaid managed care program (CCNC) that uses primary care case management (PCCM).) A rigorous difference-in-difference analysis showed (to our surprise) that the HMOs in Mecklenburg were not controlling health care cost increases any better than the traditional, non-managed care program in the East. {Schoeps, NB, WB Bandon, & RV Chaudry, ""Medicaid Expenditures under Risk-Contracting HMOs and Traditional Fee for Service: A comparison of Two North Carolina Counties,"" in MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS edited by M. Ito & Y. Nakajima (New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2008): pp. 1-26.]

Using CAHPS surveys in 2000 we compared the early version of CCNCs with the Medicaid population enrolled in HMOs in Mecklenburg county. As a result of a collaboration with Paul Cleary at Harvard & Joe Thompson in AR, we were able to oversample children with special needs. Our large survey showed no statistical difference between the two populations (both children & adults) enrolled in the 2 delivery systems in question after question dealing with access, satisfaction & utilization. But we did notice that the almost universal pattern was that those enrolled in the CCNC prototype registered as more favorable--only with a large sample size the difference was almost never statistically significant.

The take home from our 20 years of empirical work is that the current CCNC system, which is now firmly established with its wide physician acceptance across the state, is doing well in the parameters that matter to patients. Why start a new system with all the disruptions that building new delivery systems if bound to bring? The process in 1996-97 in Mecklenburg County was slow & expensive.) The wide physician acceptance of CCNC makes it an ideal base to efficiently expand Medicaid."
"CMS- Please say no and protect the children of NC and the taxpayers of America.
This is a disaster- it is simply impossible for 15 different MCOs to be cheaper than a single payer Medicaid system with nationally recognized CCNC care mgt.
JUST SAY NO!
Sure 40 other states have MCOcaid- and it is more expensive and more difficult to care for children. Stop testing this failed hypothesis that private companies can save money in the medicaid population."
"Please expand health access to include the unfortunate 500,000 members of our NC population who fall into the gap between Medicaid eligibility and ACA subsidies. It is immoral for these innocent people to be subjected to the pain of being ""throwed away."" Health equity is a human right. We ignore that principle at our collective peril. Please, do the right thing."
I am a pediatrician in North Carolina and I do not support this change! Please deny this waiver and save our Medicaid Program!
"I urge you to consider these comments to support Medicaid Expansion in North Carolina as a condition for any degree of approval for North Carolina's Medicaid Reform Waiver application.

Until one sits across the table from a low-income consumer seeking health insurance — as I have as a ACA Navigator — and must deliver the unimaginable line, ""I'm sorry, but with income under $11,770, you do not qualify for coverage under The Affordable Care Act,"" one cannot feel the profound sorrow.  I have faced their pain, anguish, disbelief, fear.  ""How can my government do this to me?"" they wonder.  (I might add that ""my government"" is presumed by most to be the Federal Government, inasmuch as the ACA was an act of Congress and the CMS administers these regulations.)  

I stand in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and I have observed with satisfaction the Marketplace process and the outcome improvements since OE1. No actions to ""reform"" Medicaid can compensate for the fact that hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians currently have no access to Medicaid at all.

As I am unable to attach a file, I will submit another comment immediately in further testimony for the many reasons why North Carolina Medicaid Expansion is so critical. Thank you.
Sincerely,

"Friends,
As Georgetown University's ""MEDICAID EXPANSION'S IMPACT ON HOSPITALS AND CLINICS"" research shows huge problems in non-expansion states, my medical practitioner friends report that they continue to see a great many uninsured patients in Buncombe County NC.  Of course this is much truer for those who are ""charity care"" or safety net providers.  And yet, so many, who are uninsured, will not attend to their health at all, putting themselves and the community at risk.
North Carolina has already begun to face loss of hospitals in part due to the reduction in uncompensated care funding.  Four are gone now in rural areas where proximity matters.  Our own Mission Hospital will survive, but it, too, is losing — and our insurance rates in NC are climbing, as hospitals seek to recover lost dollars from insured patients.  The EMS drivers who spoke at the Medicaid Reform hearing in Asheville in April emphasized that they, too, suffer the reduction in this funding, hampering their service and threatening their sustainability.  
The economic impact of Non-Expansion in North Carolina goes beyond the medical community.  In our state, over $6 billion in federal funding has been lost in 2014 and 2015, since the implementation of the ACA Marketplace in 2013-14.  Without expansion between 2016 and 2020, estimates suggest a loss of an additional $21 billion in federal funding.  
More than 43,000 jobs —  both within and beyond the health care industry -- might have been created by 2020 had NC expanded Medicaid— but that has not happened. (Cone Health Foundation Report)  This is to say nothing of the loss of tax revenue that accompanies those jobs.  The best estimates suggest that a half million people in NC would be covered under expanded Medicaid.  About three-fourths (or about 375,000) of that number will otherwise continue to be uninsured, even though the majority of them have jobs. (Wake Forest University, Health Law & Policy Program)   Small business is the most vibrant part of the economy in Asheville, my home, and yet with creative start-ups, wages are often lower, benefits are few, and part-time and seasonal workers abound. Without the saving-grace assistance of the Affordable Care Act for low income workers, both entrepreneurs and employees are penalized, and we all lose.  
Importantly, 1000 people die each year who might have accessed care through Expanded Medicaid. Please act to require Expansion now. Thank you. Catherine Schaller"
